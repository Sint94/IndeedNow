Cruise taps former Delta executive for COO post as it creeps towards commercialization
Cruise, the autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary of GM, said Friday it has hired Delta Air Lines' former chief operating officer Gil West as it makes the transition towards early commercialization. West, who had retired from Delta last year, will become Cruise's first chief operating officer. The announcement comes more than month after Cruise launched tests on public roads using autonomous vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. The testing is still being conducted in a limited geographic area in San Francisco and in one of the city's less congested neighborhoods, but it is was still viewed as a milestone for the company and a necessary step to secure a permit to launch a shared, commercial service that can charge for rides.

What is up with Tesla's value?
The last year taught us that the connection between the stock market and the economy is imprecise at best. Despite some useful commentary underscoring the two are at leastÂ somewhat linked, it's clear that many Americans can lose their jobs and financial security at the same time that stocks can keep on rising like the boom times will never end. It seems that today's market is willing to value stocks not on their past performance, current performance or analyst-expected future performance but on the rosiest future that investors have imagined for their favorite companies.

And yes, working hard to sell ads, because that's what Yahoo! did. It gathered data and it served pages and it sold ads. We watched Yahoo! get eclipsed in size and reach by Google... a more efficient and more profitable ad seller. They knew what you were searching for, so they could gather your data more efficiently and sell better ads.

What is up with Tesla's value?
The last year taught us that the connection between the stock market and the economy is imprecise at best. Despite some useful commentary underscoring the two are at leastÂ somewhat linked, it's clear that many Americans can lose their jobs and financial security at the same time that stocks can keep on rising like the boom times will never end. It seems that today's market is willing to value stocks not on their past performance, current performance or analyst-expected future performance but on the rosiest future that investors have imagined for their favorite companies.

Hyundai Elevate: âThe world's first walking car'
T his âquadrupedal' vehicle may look like a smart shopping trolley ready for a supermarket dash in some distant interstellar community. But, in fact, it's a full-size, robotic walking car, which Hyundai believes may be helpful in rescue zones when normal vehicles, even the most robust 4x4s, just can't hack it. It's called the âElevate' and by blending technology found in modern electric cars with advanced robotics, it can climb up 5ft walls, straddle a 5ft hole and step across piles of debris, thanks to the addition of four fully articulated robotic legs â and all the while keeping its passengers completely level.

Review: Mixbook focuses on quality photo prints, books, and cards

What you will find is photo prints, wall art, calendars, and a particularly deep selection of the best photo books and best photo cards. Quality seems to be Mixbook's priority, over price and selection. I do think Mixbook is one of the overall best online photo printing services, even if you're just using an iPhone 12. But the site could definitely be smoother, as I'll explain in this Mixbook Photo Printing review. Note: Since this review was initially written, Mixbook has made updates to the website, making photo book creation much smoother.

That call to arms is just one of the many warning signs on extremist sites and mainstream social media platforms that extremism experts say were easy to spot but ultimately disregarded by law enforcement in the runup to Wednesday's riot at the Capitol, which led to the deaths of five people, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick , 42, who was reportedly hit with a fire extinguisher during the melee.
