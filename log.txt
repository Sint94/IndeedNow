I spent 2 months with PS5 â here's what I love and hate so far

Except now I'm doing it with a powerful, giant new console that looks a lot like the Barclays Center sitting under my TV. I've been lucky enough to have Sony's new PlayStation 5 in my home for about two months now, and it's largely been a delight to use.

Cruise taps former Delta executive for COO post as it creeps towards commercialization
Cruise, the autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary of GM, said Friday it has hired Delta Air Lines' former chief operating officer Gil West as it makes the transition towards early commercialization. West, who had retired from Delta last year, will become Cruise's first chief operating officer.
