During the week, intraday corrections were short-lived as the index recorded yet another peak of 14,367 and was trading well above the support of three-digit Gann number of 139(00). A shift in orbit on the upside will be recorded once the Nifty confirms a move above three-digit Gann number of 145(00). The pattern of higher highs and lows, up-sloping rising moving averages and the index moving north with the breadth hovering around overbought terrain are common traits in a bullish market.
