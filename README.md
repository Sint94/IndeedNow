Nevertheless, that's not to say we haven't seen some cash skimmed off the controller's price, though this latest round of PS5 deals is offering a particularly stunning discount. You'll find the £59.99 PS5 DualSense controller available for just £50.39 at ShopTo's official eBay storefront.

> Mar 10, 2004 14,029 517 Bergen, Norway I'm in the process of replacing my TV set up, and get a 4K TV. Currently I have a 42" Toshiba 1080 TV, Apple TV 4 HD and Denon CEOL Piccolo, and I'm planning to replace all of them. Now, technology has definitively moved forward since I got any of the stuff above (and especially since I got the TV i 2009), so I'm a bit uncertain what my best options are. To get the sound from the Apple TV out, I'm currently using Airplay to the Piccolo, which works OK (lip sync is fine, but there's a picture and sound delay, which is annoying when pausing/restarting), so I want to have wired set up from now on.

The Mi QLED TV 4K 55 (yes, it is quite the mouthful) is no exception. The 55 does indicate the size of the screen and there is no variant in this, just a single model. The Mi QLED TV is quite attractive looking. It has a metallic bezel-less design which screams premium.

[Mac Mini M1](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-mini-m1-need-stereo-line-input-options.2279437/)


> On my Windows PC, there is a line-in that I was using to plug in a standard 3.5mm headphone jack so I could listen to a secondary input source at the same time as normal Windows audio. I just got an M1 mini to use daily (Windows PC will be only for PC gaming now) and tried plugging in the same 3.5mm headphone jack connector as an input from my external source, but Mac OS doesn't recognize it. Headphone output from the jack is fine, but no input. Unfortunately I learned that this jack isn't a true line input so I can't use it how I originally thought.

[Monitor only works smoothly at highest resolution](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/monitor-only-works-smoothly-at-highest-resolution.2279440/)


> Hi, I have a Dell P2715Q, and I'm having trouble getting it to work smoothly on any other resolution than its highest - 3840x2160. It's currently connected to my Mac mini 2018 with a DisplayPort to USB-C cord. I've tried to use another DisplayPort to USB-C cord, and an multiple HDMI cords, but I think I can rule out a connection issue. For the record, using an HDMI connection has resulted in curser delay. From the preferences pane, I've tried other resolutions (default for display, and scaled), but 3840x2160 seems to be the only resolution that works well.

But I was delighted to find that all of my villagers had dressed up in their best fishing attire specifically for the event. This inspired me to run around my island and snap pictures with each one of them. Here are some pictures of each of my villagers wearing their best fishing attire. Animal Crossing is one of the best Switch games with its fun seasonal events and adorable villagers.

> This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In 2014, Burlington, Vermont, the birthplace of Ben and Jerry's ice cream and the stomping grounds of Senator Bernie Sanders, announced that it had reached an energy milestone. The city of 42,000, which hugs the shore of Lake Champlain, produced enough power from renewable sources to cover all its electricity needs. Burlington, the city government proclaimed, was one of America's first 'renewable cities.' Since then, Burlington has been joined by Georgetown, Texas, Aspen, Colorado, and a few other small towns across the country.

So, whether you're a laptop warrior or you're looking for a way to upgrade or build a new PC, you'll probably want to keep an eye on the proceedings over the next week or so.
