> The meteoric rise in bitcoin has meant that within the space of four years, one Norwegian man's $27 investment turned into a forgotten $886,000 windfall. Kristoffer Koch invested 150 kroner ($26.60) in 5,000 bitcoins in 2009, after discovering them during the course of writing a thesis on encryption. He promptly forgot about them until widespread media coverage of the anonymous, decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency in April 2013 jogged his memory. Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key, something Koch had forgotten.

According to the tweet, China was in the process of "eradicating extremism" among the Uighurs, which the government claims has "emancipated" Uighur women.

> Google suspended the social media platform Parler on Friday from its Google Play app store until the 'Twitter for conservatives' adopts content moderation policies following the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump supporters. Parler, founded in 2018, has found traction among conservative users looking for alternatives to more mainstream apps like Facebook and Twitter, which moderate content more rigorously. Parler has banned users for trolling conservatives but doesn't have a formal set of moderation policies.

> Kanpur Plastipack | Company incorporated wholly owned subsidiary (WOS) - Bright Choice Venture. The Nifty's heroics on January 8 clearly shows that its glorious sprint is not about to end. During the week, intraday corrections were short-lived as the index recorded yet another peak of 14,367 and was trading well above the support of three-digit Gann number of 139(00). A shift in orbit on the upside will be recorded once the Nifty confirms a move above three-digit Gann number of 145(00). The pattern of higher highs and lows, up-sloping rising moving averages and the index moving north with the breadth hovering around overbought terrain are common traits in a bullish market.
