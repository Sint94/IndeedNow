The console only hit the shelves in November, and the controllers represented one of the biggest upgrades to the next-generation system. Nevertheless, that's not to say we haven't seen some cash skimmed off the controller's price, though this latest round of PS5 deals is offering a particularly stunning discount. You'll find the £59.99 PS5 DualSense controller available for just £50.39 at ShopTo's official eBay storefront.

> Mar 10, 2004 14,029 517 Bergen, Norway I'm in the process of replacing my TV set up, and get a 4K TV. Currently I have a 42" Toshiba 1080 TV, Apple TV 4 HD and Denon CEOL Piccolo, and I'm planning to replace all of them. Now, technology has definitively moved forward since I got any of the stuff above (and especially since I got the TV i 2009), so I'm a bit uncertain what my best options are. To get the sound from the Apple TV out, I'm currently using Airplay to the Piccolo, which works OK (lip sync is fine, but there's a picture and sound delay, which is annoying when pausing/restarting), so I want to have wired set up from now on.

The Mi QLED TV 4K 55 (yes, it is quite the mouthful) is no exception. The 55 does indicate the size of the screen and there is no variant in this, just a single model. The Mi QLED TV is quite attractive looking. It has a metallic bezel-less design which screams premium. While it does not ship with a wall-mount, it does come with metallic legs which form a very steady stand.
