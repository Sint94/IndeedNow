Of course, this time the Steelers won't be resting their first-string starters like QB Ben Roethlisberger and will be pushing themselves to the limit this time. Also coming off a restful weekend for the Steelers will be J.J. Watt and Cam Howard. Even without several impactful starters, Pittsburgh still nearly beat the Browns. It's optimistic to assume Cleveland will be moving on past week 18.

"Now, that means that if you have an underlying health condition that increases your risk of Covid and you're 25, it has to be approaching an increased risk of 100 fold to overcome the protective effects of age," said Mr Brown According to the scientist, people with rare illnesses who are particularly at risk can access an early vaccine under exceptional circumstances.

[Review: OnePlus Band is just not worth your time (or money)](https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-band-review)

OnePlus followed the Q1 with the U1 and budget-focused Y1 series, and it has carved out a niche for itself in India in this category.

Sony first announced the Airpeak drone project in November 2020, but didn't reveal any images or details about the kind of flying machine it had in store. Well, we've now seen some short videos of Airpeak in action at CES 2021 – and it's fair to say it's aimed at the high-end professional market. What we're looking at is a pro rival to the likes of the DJI Inspire 2, rather than affordable consumer drones like the DJI Mavic Air 2.

> Alfred Gescheidt/Getty Images Facebook, Microsoft and Google have joined a growing list of big banks and other major companies pausing their political spending following last week's violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. One after another, corporate responses have escalated. Some have suspended donations to lawmakers who objected to the certification of the election. Many have halted all of their political donations for a few months. A few went as far as to support the removal of the president. "The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy," said National Association of Manufacturers CEO Jay Timmons, urging Vice President Mike Pence to consider invoking the 25th Amendment that allows removal of a president deemed unfit to serve.

That includes posts you previously deleted on Parler. Over the past few days, archivists have been pulling content from Parler in order to store them for legal and historical purposes. Archivists began to save the data because they were concerned that users would remove their posts, deleting possible evidence of crime at the Capitol. However, once companies like Amazon announced they were ending their business relationships with Parler, it became a race to archive the content before the platform went offline.

> A few months after Apple released its newest iPhone series, it has been reported that the iPhone 12 costs as much as 21 per cent more to produce compared to the earlier iPhone 11. The reason behind this is the newer generation of parts that went into the phone. As per a report by Counterpoint Research, the new iPhone's 5G components and the A14 Bionic chipset contributes to the increased costs, taking the Bill of Materials (BoM) to $431. 'Assuming a 38% mmWave mix, the blended materials cost for the iPhone 12 with 128GB NAND flash is nearly $415, a 21% increase over its predecessor.

[Review: Logitech's colorful G733 headset stands out with style](https://www.androidcentral.com/logitech-g733-review)


> I've tested a bunch of wireless and wired headsets over the past few weeks, and the latest on my ears is the Logitech G733. While I can't say it's my favorite of the bunch, it's certainly a damn good headset in its own right. It can't compete with its Astro cousins like the A40, but it isn't trying to. This is more of a mid-tier headset for someone who doesn't want to spend too much money but still wants a wireless experience. What's better is that it supports DTS:X 2.0 virtual surround sound. Though you lose that on PS5, you're still getting good audio quality, just nothing spectacular.

> Electronic learning doesn't necessarily require a keyboard and mouse. Apple's iPad wasn't the first tablet computer, but when it arrived in spring 2010, it changed everything. Now, with millions of apps on Apple and Android devices, the tablet is king, every bit as much as the laptop. In many ways it's even better, especially as far as children are concerned. The tablet is unbeatably portable – thin, lightweight and not much bigger than the size of the display. The touchscreen interface is hugely intuitive and since a virtual keyboard can appear on the display, you don't really need anything else.
