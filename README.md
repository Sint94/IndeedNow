Essentially, Apple Music HiFi will provide a high-quality music experience to listeners.

> If you're excited for the new iPad Pro 2021, or perhaps one of the tablets we're expecting Apple to debut later in the year like the new iPad or iPad Mini 6, news probably hasn't escaped you of possible stock shortages (or perhaps news had escaped you, so we're sorry you had to find out this way).Word is that when each of the new iPads goes on sale, stock will be pretty limited - we've seen the same thing for PS5s, Xbox Series Xs and RTX 3090 graphics cards, and apparently iPads are next.If you're trying to buy one, then, you might find lots of retailers out of stock, or with units in just a few configurations, and if you try to order one there might be a several-month wait time.

> Bit o' background: While I've always loved computers and dabbled with web dev as a kid, I recently (6ish months?) started coding again hardcore. I had just had a business fail, money was tight as shit, debt to our eyeballs... and I wanted to start again with one of my oldest passions that I'd always been afraid to pursue. So I hunkered down and got into Python, because I remembered liking the language.I pretty quickly got a job in non-Python web dev (Angular and Node.Js, which I was competent enough in thanks to dabbling) but it was awful.

> The first film made such a splash that Aquaman 2 soon became inevitable. That's because the highest-grossing movie ever based on a DC Comics character doesn't belong to any of the famous trinity of Batman, Superman or Wonder Woman. Instead, the Jason Momoa-starring, James Wan-directed Aquaman beat them all – the new king of Atlantis was also crowned DC's king of the box office.It's something of a sea-change for a character who'd traditionally been the butt of the joke in comic-book circles – in everything from Family Guy to the fake James Cameron movie in Entourage.

The Amazon Echo Frames (Gen 2) may sound like another half-hearted attempt by a tech company to shove smart virtual assistants where they don't belong, further complicating and confusing our already crazy lives. But I'm here to tell you that these are actually pretty well thought out, designed, and implemented. After all, they've already been wear-tested for over a year by hundreds of nerds like me.

> Chances are, you or someone in your family has some old slides laying around. Wouldn't it be nice to have them in a digital format that you could share over email or display on your TV screen? We tested two different DIY ways to scan them in. One is a $140 digital scanner while the other is a free app called SlideScan. The app is unique in that all you need to scan your slides is your iPhone or Android. It works really well, but we found that the process is more time consuming and the final results could be hit or miss.

> In the real world – the world on which the global economy runs – we don't expose every aspect of our financial activity in public. We want to be able to select which parties can access our financial data and under what circumstances – for example, our credit history or bank transactions. The problem with the blockchain world is that this financial privacy doesn't really exist. This has led to pretty bad abuses, such as the practice of front-running' where a nefarious person can take advantage of you immediately after seeing your transaction on a public blockchain.

[Google is now rolling out the May update to supported Pixels](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_is_now_rolling_out_the_may_update_to_supported_pixels-news-48945.php)


> It's the first Monday of the month, and you know what that means? A Google update. Of Android. For its Pixel line. Well, those that are still supported anyway. We're talking Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G, and Pixel 5. That's the entire list. All of these devices aside from the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 have build RQ2A.210505.002 headed towards them, while the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 get build RQ2A.210505.003. As usual with Google updates, expect this one to take multiple weeks reaching all of the units out there in the wild, in a very staged rollout.

> At the center of the lawsuit is Fortnite, the hugely popular video game made by Epic that was kicked out of Apple's App Store last summer for flouting its rules on digital payments by establishing its own system. Apple (AAPL) gets a 30% cut of many in-app purchases on iOS devices and does not allow alternative payment systems. Fortnite's removal from the App Store prompted Epic to sue Apple. On day one, Epic and its first witness — the company's CEO, Tim Sweeney — sought to establish that Apple's App Store and its refusal to allow other app stores on its platform constitute anti-competitive behavior.

Skydio is best known as a pioneer of self-flying drone tech, but in recent years has shifted its attention away from a consumer market dominated by Chinese giant DJI to courting enterprise customers instead. This switch is partly due to geopolitics. The US government blacklisted various Chinese drones over spying fears last year, meaning law enforcement, military, and federal customers are looking more to US firms instead.

> OPINION: Is the App Store a monopoly? Something odd happened this week. Apple's stock price dropped nearly 5 per cent following impressive quarterly profits of US$1.40 a share versus the industry's estimate of US$0.98.In this February 5 photo, an Apple store employee wears personal protective equipment in New York. Closer analysis reveals that its revenue was up 66 per cent for iPhones, 70 per cent for Macs, 79 per cent for iPads, 25 per cent for wearables. This, to my simple mind, suggests that its share price should be going up, not down.

Although the stunt was covered by CBS News, BBC News, The Guardian, and others, it did actually make a significant point. By removing the physical piece, the group – calling itself 'Burnt Banksy' – proved that the value of the piece wasn't affected by being destroyed, given that the NFT went up so much in value.

While the anonymity of Craigslist is an appeal for some, being able to see who you are selling to or who you are buying something from is preferred by many people.  Historically, Facebook Marketplace has made it very easy to see who exactly you're buying from or selling to by including their full name and a link to their Facebook profile, but I noticed recently that there's been a change to the site's design.

Because if it's just ‘an Apple Watch', then the Apple Watch SE is an under-rated hit in the making, the better-value smartwatch to get with all the best perks at a great price.However, it doesn't manage to address the flaws that remain in Apple's smartwatch line, despite some notable advantages and a starting price of just $279 / £269 / AU$429. It offers the best of what you'd expect without offering anything new, so you'll be waiting on the fabled Apple Watch SE 2 for any big changes.

> Huawei P40 dealsThe Huawei P40 is a top phone with some fantastic hardware combined to make a stunning experience when it comes to camera, battery life, and a variety of other top-end features you'll want from a modern smartphone.Much like every recent Huawei phone, the P40 is hampered by its software. The Huawei ban in the US has restricted the Chinese company's use of the Google Mobile Services apps, so you're now left with a much more limited experience.That's mostly owing to the lack of Google Play Store functionality, and while the Huawei AppGallery - the company's alternative app store - does offer a number of apps, it's hard for Huawei to compete with the Google behemoth that many developers have flocked to for years.

One YouTuber decided to fix that by dismantling an AirTag and turning it into something much slimmer. Apple's AirTag is now here and it's generally been well received. But there's one problem that we just can't quite get away from – an AirTag is just too bulky to be put into a wallet. That is, it was until one YouTuber decided to fix all that.

As a result, not only do we get a pretty solid phone, whether you're buying it unlocked or with carrier incentives, but we also get a phone that punches above its price point in most categories. Battery life is great, performance is steady most of the time, and even the cameras do pretty decently during the day. The only downside is that the 120Hz screen doesn't get as bright as the competition. $500 at Samsung Larger 120Hz screen Great battery life Four years of security updates IP67 water resistance Tons of carrier incentives No mmWave support Screen washes out Weaker cameras, especially at night The middle child of Google's 2020 lineup is still a great option for 5G on a budget, and with a beefier processor than the A52 5G and support for mmWave on the Verizon model, the Pixel 4a 5G is the more pragmatic pick if you're going to be paying full price.

The Oculus Quest experience went beyond what was expected of a VR headset by being more than just affordable — it was as easy to use as a video game console. Since that launch, Facebook has acquired several VR game development studios, brought several developers onboard with its Oculus Store, and changed the paradigm of what people expect from the standalone VR experience.

However, the same mission that has helped it grow to a business valued at $2.4 billion with over 500 million registered learners, has led to tensions that continue to define the business. How do you survive as a startup if you don't want to charge users? How do you design a startup that isn't too hard to lose people, but isn't too easy to compromise education? How do you balance monetization goals while also keeping education as a product free? For my first EC-1, I spent months with Duolingo executives, investors, and of course, competitors, to answer some of these questions.

That seemed particularly likely when Mr Musk appeared to link his interest in the cryptocurrency to his appearance on the show, tweeting the date of his guest hosting spot and calling himself the 'Dogefather'.But the appearance also came after the Tesla and SpaceX boss urged people to exercise 'caution' when investing in cryptocurrencies.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and rapper Snoop Dogg. Dogecoin is itself an 'altcoin,' as cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin are often referred to, but there are now several imitators that are attempting to ride on the 'tailwind' of the frenzy surrounding the Musk-championed meme crypto.

> An out-of-control Chinese rocket has finally fallen to Earth over the Indian Ocean, according to organisations who had been tracking it.China's Long March 5B rocket was originally launched in late April to carry the first part of China's Tianhe module, which will serve as the core of its planned crewed space station. But the rocket booster itself went into orbit, and began an uncontrolled re-entry that led to fears it could come down above a populated area.It had been difficult to predict where or when the spacecraft might fall back down to Earth because of an array of unknown details, both about the rocket itself but also the way that the atmosphere would act on it.

The US Pentagon had been tracking the rocket body since last week but because of the unusual tumbling of the rocket body and its orbit it had been difficult to predict where -- exactly -- the huge piece of space junk would fall back to the planet.

Second place, though – at least if you ask me – has to go to the injustice of Tenet missing out on a nomination for Best Original Score. Ludwig Göransson (the composer of the toe-tapping theme to The Mandalorian you like so much) created an innovative, thrilling soundtrack that even goes backwards at key moments, to reflect the characters' own journeys through time in the film. Tenet's score is one thing about the Christopher Nolan's Bond-esque sci-fi thriller that I recommend unconditionally.

Jag hittade ett litet program vid namn AutoHDR som gör att det inte behövs. Det är skamligt att Microsoft inte fixat detta själva än. Förhoppningsvis kommer det en fix senare. https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e3e9816a4d0e7ddbb6bc30c6a8a2316349aa3718fad5a94ae37f9222dd1f4e79/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f436f646563746f72792f4175746f4844522f6d61696e2f53637265656e73686f74732f5374617475735f312d362d302e706e67 https://camo.

[Just wanted to share a failed experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/n8egb1/just_wanted_to_share_a_failed_experiment/)


> fileSo I was trying out a new method of data compression where the binary sequence of a file gets converted into a huge decimal number and is then represented as the product of two smaller ones the bit_length sum of which is smaller than that of the original number. The program uses trial and error to find a perfect divider who satisfies this condition so the process can take a while. The idea is that those two resulting numbers can be multiplied anytime to yield the original number and therefore the binary source of the compressed file, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way.

Apple, the maker of the iPhone, and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, wrapped up the first week of testimony on Friday, with the iPhone inventor trying to fend off accusations from the video game developer that its App Store constitutes a monopoly and that it has engaged in anti-competitive behavior.

Host Elon Musk, playing himself, rushes to mission control when NASA's Mars mission goes horribly off the rails. Sacrifice will be necessary to save the crew, and a hero soon emerges in Chad. Musical guest Miley Cyrus also pops up as a fellow astronaut and soon-to-be baby mama to Chad's unborn child. But it's Musk who has the last laugh in the end when he throws back to his recurring IRL faux pas where he insists that "a bunch of people will probably die" once we embark on crewed missions to Mars.

Apple's AirTag was introduced during its April 2021 event. The AirTag is Apple's version of an item tracker that takes advantage of the Find My network to locate missing items.

Still, the V12 Detect Slim is expected to bring everything that's great about the V15 Detect, just in a slightly different and more affordable package.

Yet the phone costs just 200 British pounds, or about $280 at today's currency conversion rate, meaning that 5G is no longer only found on pricey mid- and high-specification phones. But cheap phones can also be substandard, especially when an 'expensive' feature like 5G gets slotted in to grab some headlines. The Realme 8 5G is cheap, but does it feel like it's cheap? MediaTek lends a hand How does Realme offer a phone with 5G for such a low price? One of the reasons is the phone uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor, rather than a Qualcomm chip seen in mid-range smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G and the Google Pixel 4a 5G.

Last year's Mi Band 5 introduced a large OLED screen and a new charging connector, and for 2021 Xiaomi is rolling out a few upgrades with the Mi Band 6.

> Wing Although advances have clearly been made in recent years, there are still a number of obstacles preventing drone delivery services from going mainstream. Top of the list is, of course, safety, with regulators keen for clear proof that any autonomous aircraft flying overhead won't suddenly crash into an obstacle — or indeed each other — putting people on the ground in danger. Another problem that gets less attention is noise. If drone delivery really is to become a part of everyday life for urban communities, the companies developing such aircraft will have to make them much quieter or risk a backlash from those irritated by the buzzing rotors as the machines fly back and forth during delivery runs.
