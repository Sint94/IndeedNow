[DualSense controller hits lowest price ever in latest PS5 deals](https://www.techradar.com/news/dualsense-controller-hits-lowest-price-ever-in-latest-ps5-deals)


> (Image credit: Future) PS5 controller deals have been rare over the last few months. The console only hit the shelves in November, and the controllers represented one of the biggest upgrades to the next-generation system. Nevertheless, that's not to say we haven't seen some cash skimmed off the controller's price, though this latest round of PS5 deals is offering a particularly stunning discount. You'll find the £59.99 PS5 DualSense controller available for just £50.39 at ShopTo's official eBay storefront.

> Mar 10, 2004 14,029 517 Bergen, Norway I'm in the process of replacing my TV set up, and get a 4K TV. Currently I have a 42" Toshiba 1080 TV, Apple TV 4 HD and Denon CEOL Piccolo, and I'm planning to replace all of them. Now, technology has definitively moved forward since I got any of the stuff above (and especially since I got the TV i 2009), so I'm a bit uncertain what my best options are. To get the sound from the Apple TV out, I'm currently using Airplay to the Piccolo, which works OK (lip sync is fine, but there's a picture and sound delay, which is annoying when pausing/restarting), so I want to have wired set up from now on.

> Xiaomi seems to have the pulse of the Indian market. From a soap dispenser to a 4K TV, they seem to have it all. The products are popular, well-built and designed and very affordable. The Mi QLED TV 4K 55 (yes, it is quite the mouthful) is no exception. The 55 does indicate the size of the screen and there is no variant in this, just a single model. The Mi QLED TV is quite attractive looking. It has a metallic bezel-less design which screams premium. While it does not ship with a wall-mount, it does come with metallic legs which form a very steady stand.

> Donald Trump faced quite a lot of backlash following violent protest at the US Capitol by Trump supporters. The event, that disrupted the Electoral College debate and lead to the death of five people, was said to have been instigated by Trump's social media messages ever since the November presidential election. As a result, Trump's social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat have been removed, right-leaning social media app Parler has been suspended from Google Play, and pro-Trump subreddit ‘r/DonaldTrump' has been blocked by Reddit.

Fitbit Pay allows you to use your smartwatch to pay for things at stores that accept NFC, and it's an incredibly useful trick. Fitbit Pay is supported on older models like the Ionic and Charge 3, and newer wearables such as the Charge 4, Versa 2, Versa 3, and Sense. Not as many banks support Fitbit Pay compared to the likes of Google and Samsung Pay, but the list is growing all the time.

> (Image credit: SUP3R5) The black PS5 from SUP3R5 has officially sold out after going on sale on January 8. However, more consoles could be on the way in the future.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the launch did not go smoothly. Many users encountered payment issues and were charged for pre-orders that weren't actually available. Production of the black PS5 was limited to just 304 units, and demand far exceeded expectations: a trend that has become all too familiar whenever PS5 stock appears.SUP3R5 has since apologized on Twitter for the frustration some users faced, and vowed to do better in the future.

> Source: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central It's the middle of the afternoon on a Friday and I'm typing this out on my back deck using a Chromebook. I love the darn things and any time I can get away from a desk during the workday I try to do it, and always with a Chromebook in tow. To me, a really well-built mid-range Chromebook with plenty of power and plenty of storage is just right. Of course, the best Chromebook for me might not be the best Chromebook for you. But if you're like me and want a modestly priced Chromebook that outperforms and out delivers, I think Acer has just what you're looking for in 2021 with the new Chromebook Spin 514.
