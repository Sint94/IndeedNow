Of course, this time the Steelers won't be resting their first-string starters like QB Ben Roethlisberger and will be pushing themselves to the limit this time. Also coming off a restful weekend for the Steelers will be J.J. Watt and Cam Howard. Even without several impactful starters, Pittsburgh still nearly beat the Browns. It's optimistic to assume Cleveland will be moving on past week 18.

"Now, that means that if you have an underlying health condition that increases your risk of Covid and you're 25, it has to be approaching an increased risk of 100 fold to overcome the protective effects of age," said Mr Brown According to the scientist, people with rare illnesses who are particularly at risk can access an early vaccine under exceptional circumstances.

[Review: OnePlus Band is just not worth your time (or money)](https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-band-review)

OnePlus followed the Q1 with the U1 and budget-focused Y1 series, and it has carved out a niche for itself in India in this category.

Sony first announced the Airpeak drone project in November 2020, but didn't reveal any images or details about the kind of flying machine it had in store. Well, we've now seen some short videos of Airpeak in action at CES 2021 – and it's fair to say it's aimed at the high-end professional market. What we're looking at is a pro rival to the likes of the DJI Inspire 2, rather than affordable consumer drones like the DJI Mavic Air 2.

> Alfred Gescheidt/Getty Images Facebook, Microsoft and Google have joined a growing list of big banks and other major companies pausing their political spending following last week's violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. One after another, corporate responses have escalated. Some have suspended donations to lawmakers who objected to the certification of the election. Many have halted all of their political donations for a few months. A few went as far as to support the removal of the president. "The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy," said National Association of Manufacturers CEO Jay Timmons, urging Vice President Mike Pence to consider invoking the 25th Amendment that allows removal of a president deemed unfit to serve.

That includes posts you previously deleted on Parler. Over the past few days, archivists have been pulling content from Parler in order to store them for legal and historical purposes. Archivists began to save the data because they were concerned that users would remove their posts, deleting possible evidence of crime at the Capitol. However, once companies like Amazon announced they were ending their business relationships with Parler, it became a race to archive the content before the platform went offline.

As per a report by Counterpoint Research, the new iPhone's 5G components and the A14 Bionic chipset contributes to the increased costs, taking the Bill of Materials (BoM) to $431. 'Assuming a 38% mmWave mix, the blended materials cost for the iPhone 12 with 128GB NAND flash is nearly $415, a 21% increase over its predecessor.

[Review: Logitech's colorful G733 headset stands out with style](https://www.androidcentral.com/logitech-g733-review)


> I've tested a bunch of wireless and wired headsets over the past few weeks, and the latest on my ears is the Logitech G733. While I can't say it's my favorite of the bunch, it's certainly a damn good headset in its own right. It can't compete with its Astro cousins like the A40, but it isn't trying to. This is more of a mid-tier headset for someone who doesn't want to spend too much money but still wants a wireless experience. What's better is that it supports DTS:X 2.0 virtual surround sound. Though you lose that on PS5, you're still getting good audio quality, just nothing spectacular.

> Electronic learning doesn't necessarily require a keyboard and mouse. Apple's iPad wasn't the first tablet computer, but when it arrived in spring 2010, it changed everything. Now, with millions of apps on Apple and Android devices, the tablet is king, every bit as much as the laptop. In many ways it's even better, especially as far as children are concerned. The tablet is unbeatably portable – thin, lightweight and not much bigger than the size of the display. The touchscreen interface is hugely intuitive and since a virtual keyboard can appear on the display, you don't really need anything else.

You can direct list, and merely start to trade. You can host a hybrid auction-offering, like what Unity did. Hell, Google showed us back in the day that a reverse-Dutch auction is possible, after which no one else deigned to try it. And then there's the blank-check method: Instead of taking your company private, some rich people list a pile of hungry money instead, and then go hunting for a private company to merge with.

The real kicker is that this is the processor that will likely power the Galaxy S21 in India unless Samsung flips a switch or something and decides to launch it with Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 888–that is the version expected to be sold internationally including in the US.

Conversations that last weeks or even days get lost and context gets fuzzy. Threads scroll up into the past and are never seen again. Despite the 'asychronous' claim, you have to keep a steady eye on it and reply in realtime or the conversation will move on without you. Anyone who takes the time to ponder and respond thoughtfully with context and explanation will find that they're too late.

> Big Tech has become the subject of increasing scrutiny by governments across the world in recent years, perhaps none more so than Google, which thanks to its dominance of the search business and its control of Android, the most popular mobile operating system, exerts a stupendous degree of control over the products and information we consume. That influence has often resulted in the company fielding allegations of anti-competitive practices, with the latest of these being a lawsuit by YouTube rival Rumble, which claims that Google is "unfairly rigging its search algorithms" to favor YouTube, which Google owns, over its competitors (via The Wall Street Journal).

> At CES 2021, Nvidia launched a wide range of graphics cards, both for laptops and even a new Ampere desktop graphics card: the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060. One of the big things I noticed, however, is that a couple of the SKUs now have an inflated VRAM spec, and it kind of makes the entire Nvidia RTX 3000 lineup a bit confusing. At the top-end of the new mobile stack you have the RTX 3080 with 16GB, but the RTX 3080 for desktop has 10GB. Similarly, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 has 12GB of VRAM, while the RTX 3060 Ti – a graphics card that should be more powerful and is 20% more expensive – has less VRAM at 8GB.

[Samsung Galaxy S21 launch: what to expect from S21 Ultra to SmartTags](https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-launch-five-things-we-expect-to-see)


> We're expecting several devices and a few surprises when the Samsung Galaxy S21 phones launch on January 14. We've heard plenty of rumors about the phones, so we have a good idea of what we could see from them – but there's always the chance that Samsung completely surprises us with new products.Samsung is announcing its phones over a month earlier than we expected. The company often announces its handsets in February or March around the time of Mobile World Congress. While the company hasn't explicitly explained why it's moved up its timetable, we can guess that the online-only nature of these events motivated Samsung to just introduce its first big devices of the year without waiting for whatever MWC 2021 brings.

> The Astro A50 is a well-known high-end headset, so I was excited to try it out for the first time with the PS5. It's comfortable, even after very extended sessions playing some of the best PS5 games such as Demon's Souls. Unfortunately, there are some shortcomings PS5 owners need to be aware of, which are only exacerbated by this headset's hefty price tag. The pricetag is consistent if you want to use it on your PC since functionality, fortunately, isn't limited there.

> In 2020, we all learned the hard way just how bad our laptop webcams all are. They're a horrible, grainy mess, and they make for a terrible videoconferencing experience. That's why I was certain that coming to CES 2021 , the virtual show-floor would be flooded with laptops with 1080p webcams. Surely, after over eight months of constant blurry Zoom calls, companies like Lenovo, HP, Dell, and Asus would relieve our pain. But I was wrong. Very, very wrong. Only one company, MSI, had the smarts to bring a proper 1080p webcam to its laptops — and it's not the one you would have thought.

The chunky, 17-inch gaming laptop now has the updated chassis to match the 15-inch model, the GE66 Raider. But both laptops have the updated webcam, connectivity, and graphics. Rather than moving to AMD, the GE76 Raider sticks with the older 10th-gen Intel H processors.

Although I would greatly appreciate the integration with my Macbook, I will miss a few Android specific features from my current Google Pixel - specifically, "silence unknown callers" and "call screening." Additionally, Android allows for a number of robust third-party (largely unapproved) ad blocking services. Are there iOS alternatives to these things or will Apple's walled garden largely prohibit such solutions? 2. From what I can discern, my Macbook already allows me to send iMessages without being tied to a phone number - how would directly tying the Messages client to an iPhone improve the experience? 3.

> One of the best phones of 2019, the Xiaomi Mi Note 10, didn't see a successor last year, which had us thinking the Xiaomi Mi Note 11 might never arrive. But it seems we might still see the phone. Twitter user @_the_tech_guy, who has a record of unearthing useful information, found references to both the Mi Note 11 and the Xiaomi Mi Mix 4 in code for MIUI, Xiaomi's user interface which sits on top of Android. MIUI code often contains references to future Xiaomi phones - the Mi Note 10's 108MP camera was leaked that way - and it seems likely such code would only be added leading up to a phone's launch.

That's all on top of a bolder sound and better water and sweat resistance for workouts. $200 at Samsung Bolder sound Solid ANC performance Dynamic ambient mode 360 audio ability Significant water resistance Smaller charging case Fit requires more fidgeting Proprietary ear tips Lower battery life Samsung righted some important wrongs when they made these earbuds as successors to the originals, and the benefits are a major leap in battery life, plus improved audio fidelity.

What Happened:  Electrek  reports Tuesday that Wettbewerbszentrale has judged the software names as being misleading. Tesla stock did not seem to respond negatively to the news and was trading 0.86% higher at $1,510 at the time of publication.  The decision prevents Tesla from including "full potential for autonomous driving" and "autopilot inclusive" in German advertising, according to Reuters .

> Need? No. Does it help? Sure.And let's talk a little bit about why and how. The first, and most obvious, is credentialism: people will respect your background more if you have a degree. It's bullshit, it's unfair, and it's increasingly inaccurate as collegiate programs focus more and more on being job-training programs (bad job-training programs).Second, however, is just that mastering a skill is hard. No matter how much an auto-didact you are, there are a lot more ways to program wrong than there are to programming "correctly", and navigating that thicket of failure is a lot easier if you have good instructors and a firm theoretical footing.

It said there had been "confusion" about its message. Since the announcement and notifications went out across its platform, millions of people around the world have downloaded alternative encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram.

Taking reviews or review rating systems at face value is what most consumers do because it's a quick way to make a decision, but that's what those that create fake reviews are counting on. There are companies in countries outside the U.S. selling large numbers of fake reviews, so it's always a good idea to watch for grammar and language errors, or suspicious usernames.

In the same thread, he took time to call out a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called 'bluesky,' which is aiming to build up an 'open decentralized standard for social media' that Twitter is just one part of. Researchers involved with bluesky reveal to TechCrunch an initiative still in its earliest stages that could fundamentally shift the power dynamics of the social web.

This works with Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, but because it is larger than the S Pen, storing it within the new case won't be possible.The pricing and availability details of the S Pen Pro haven't been announced and it is expected to be made available later this year.

> Scientists have located a ‘Super Earth' that is being believed to orbit one of the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The exoplanet gets its title as it is suspected to be around three times the mass of Earth, with a size 50% larger than our home planet.The planet, known as TOI-561b, has been described in a new study accepted for publication in the The Astronomical Journal. Despite the planet's mass, its density is about the same as that of Earth, astronomers found in the study.'We report the discovery of TOI-561, a multi-planet system in the galactic thick disk that contains a rocky, ultra-short period planet (USP),' the study mentions.

Yes, we had the 'Space Zoom' gimmick at last year's S20 Ultra launch. But this time we're talking about genuinely useful optical zoom . Like the Huawei Mate 40 Pro Plus , the S21 Ultra combines two dedicated telephoto cameras – one offering 3x zoom, the other 10x zoom.

The amount a user should invest in setting up even the most basic home studio depends on what the user is looking to focus on. Cover singers, rappers, and podcasters usually look to record good quality audio and may not be involved in other aspects of music production. USB microphones are a great choice for beginners who want to focus solely on recording vocals. XLR microphones need an audio interface to work and cannot be connected directly to a computer but they allow multiple mics to be connected at once and are ideal for live shows, elaborate podcasting sessions, and music production.

Even the server that hosts it, such as Signal or iMessage on Apple devices, can't decrypt and read what someone wrote. If those servers were ever hacked, hackers wouldn't be able to read the messages, either.

[2021 is the year of the Chromebook: here's why](https://www.techradar.com/news/is-2021-the-year-of-the-chrombook)


> For several years now, Chromebooks have slowly gained a pretty dedicated following as former skeptics became converts - and even prosthelytizers - of the lightweight Chrome OS and the highly affordable laptops it powers. Still, it hasn't come close to challenging Microsoft or Apple - or even Linux - as the operating system of choice for the vast majority of consumers.There are a whole host of reasons for this, not the least of which is Microsoft's far-sighted strategy of licensing its operating systems to OEMs, which helped it capture over 95% of the PC market in the early to mid 1990s, a market position that has only slightly eroded due to the popularity of Apple's competing OSX-powered laptops and desktops.

> Some in the Biden administration are likely to advocate for municipal broadband networks. Always controversial, building these networks may be a particularly poor choice for most localities in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if federal subsidy dollars become available, municipal broadband networks require significant ongoing capital investment to operate, often funded by issuing new debt. Cities have seen their tax revenues shrink with pandemic shutdowns, and taking on additional debt to support broadband networks will be difficult to justify.

Instead of focusing on epic superheroics, the new Disney Plus TV show turns Avengers Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) and Vision into a married couple at the center of their very own sitcom.While the first two episodes are set in the 1950s and 1960s, however – and feature many of the sitcom tropes of their respective eras – that doesn't mean WandaVision sits between the 1940s-set Agent Carter and the 1970-set sequence in Avengers: Endgame in the MCU timeline.

In April of 2017, Microsoft Edge features, and functionality improvements highlighted the Windows 10 Creators Update , but not everyone was happy with Edge's advancements. For example, Microsoft pundit Paul Thurrott called out some of the browser's most crucial failings, and these limitations were definitely glaring. One of his complaints was the lack of a full-screen view , and that unlike Chrome, hitting the F11 key did nothing in Edge.

[Attacking the DeFi ecosystem with flash loans for fun and profit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03810v2)


> Download PDF Abstract: Credit allows a lender to loan out surplus capital to a borrower. In the traditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its debt, the lender hence requires an upfront collateral from the borrower, plus interest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders can offer flash loans, i.e. loans that are only valid within one transaction and must be repaid by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a number of interesting attack possibilities, some of which have been exploited recently (February 2020).

But actually deploying it here is "very fragmented" given the maze of local regulations and agencies that telecom companies have to navigate across 50 states, said Jefferson Wang, head of 5G strategy at Accenture.

> Apple rolled out four separate smartphone models at its October 13 launch event. That's the largest range we've ever seen from the company. While the iPhone 12 itself is the expected mainstream front runner, the iPhone 12 mini provides something excitingly new. Not only is it a very small phone at a time when such things are as rare as hen's teeth, but it also manages to shrink things down without compromising on features or specifications. All of which begs the question: is the iPhone 12 really the best option for most people? Or is Apple's smaller, cheaper alternative a better buy? iPhone 12 vs iPhone 12 mini price and availability The iPhone 12 hit shops on October 23, while the iPhone 12 mini landed a little later on November 13.

> How many parents really know what their children are exposed to on the internet? We're familiar with the many dangers lurking there: exposure to harmful content, bullying, communication with strangers, sexual exploitation, pornography, identity theft and fraud. Most parents don't want to go snooping through their kids' phones and computers, but even if they did, they can't supervise their children all the time, and the dangers are too sophisticated for ordinary people to deal with. The usual solution for parents is to rely on parental control technologies – various kinds of software that filters and blocks content or follows kids' internet habits without their knowledge.

I have downloaded the iPhone_5.5_13.4_17E255_Restore.ipsw and tried to install it with reiboot and dr.phone. (Windows 10 machine) Both give errors and I am unable to upgrade.

Source code: https://github.com/chonyy/ML-auto-baseball-pitching-overlay I know some of you may have already seen it. However, I have made some improvements and I will want to share it. The model accuracy is hugely increased I implemented Polyfit to keep track of the ball just in case it lost the detection in some of the frames After all, I'm happy to say that it now is able to overlay as many clips as you want!

In an interview to air on Fox Broadcasting's 'Fox News Sunday' this Sunday (Jan. 17), Cook told anchor Chris Wallace that Apple 'looked at the incitement to violence that was on there and… we don't consider that free speech.' Asked by Wallace whether Apple's booting of Parler, which had become popular among Trump loyalists as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook, would only serve to drive the app's users 'underground,' Cook responded, 'Well, we've only suspended them, Chris.

Lebowitz's musings across seven episodes are organized by loose themes, such as 'Metropolitan Transit' and 'Library Services,' with the more recent footage interspersed with clips from older interviews. That's pretty much it as far as structure goes; while Lebowitz shares a number of amusing anecdotes, there's no attempt to explore the broader arc of her career or explain why we're watching a show about her.

> In order to consider an initiative around hyperautomation, firstly it is important to examine the current systems, reengineer the processes as required and eliminate unnecessary steps in tune with the business realities.Organisations that have embraced digital transformation have recognised the advantages that Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has to offer and many of them have implemented it in their key business areas. By enabling businesses to automate certain tasks, RPA has eliminated mundane manual tasks, enhanced cycle time thus ensuring predictability, accuracy, standardization, flexibility and better control.

In a world where information, data and words can be misconstrued, misunderstood and manipulated, we need to move away from the idea of free speech and instead to one of rights to speech. Rights confer a privilege to be understood and considered when communicating. This should bring to bear the implication of speech associated with context, audience, platform and interpretation.

> BL Research BureauThe rupee (INR) settled higher by 18 paise last week as it ended at 73.06 versus preceding week's close of 73.24 against the dollar (USD). However, the local currency seems to have opened with a considerable gap-down today, erasing last week's gain. That is, INR has opened at 73.23 and it is currently testing the key level of 73.25.A break below this level can drag the local currency towards the support band of 73.40 and 73.50. A breach of these levels can intensify the sell-off and take the exchange rate to 73.

Bird says that scooters can skid for various reasons, all of which point to serious problems with the rider of the vehicle: hazardous behavior, excessive breaking, and worn-out tires. The skid detection uses the scooter's existing vehicle diagnostics sensors, including an accelerometer that detects whether the scooter is upright or has been dumped on its side, and whether its components (including wheels and brakes) are all working as expected.

> That dismays Republicans who cheered Reagan's move — and say the current GOP proposals look a lot like a Fairness Doctrine for the internet. 'I am a big Trump supporter, but I totally disagree with the approach here,' said Mark Fowler, a Reagan appointee who led the charge for rolling back the doctrine as chair of the Federal Communications Commission. 'I think it's a blunderbuss, kind of a Panzer, heavy-handed approach to trying to control the press.' Then-FCC Republican Mike O'Rielly expressed similar misgivings last summer after the president proposed a wide-ranging regulatory and legislative crackdown against bias in social media.

Late last year, governments in the U.S., China and Europe separately began investigating whether Big Tech is too big. The scrutiny in Washington is expected to continue under a Biden administration, which also appears inclined to continue the Trump administration's export restrictions against Chinese companies that are reshuffling global supply chains.

If that sounds familiar, you're not alone. The pandemic has taken a toll on everyone's mental health, and there's data to prove it. While there's been ample discussion of the economic fallout from a global pandemic, the toll it takes on our collective mental health is harder to quantify. It's almost impossible to stay at home for months on end, cancel years worth of events, and disrupt even basic routines like how we shop for groceries without a significant impact on our mental health.

> Cloud hosting has changed the hosting industry for the better, allowing for increasing reliability and resilience for clients. Signing up for a simple web hosting package would usually buy you a defined block of resources on a single server: register your domain name, then choose this much web space, that much bandwidth, maybe a set amount of RAM or CPU cores.While this works well for many websites, having fixed resources can be a problem for larger projects.

> My trusted iPhone 6S stopped working during the weekend and all of sudden I had no other option but to buy a new phone. I liked the old form factor, and settled on the 12 mini. I assume many people on this forum are updating the phones much more often, so I thought to write a few lines on what if feels like to fast-forward five years in the world of mobile phones. My gut feeling is that the development has been surprisingly incremental. Feels like much smaller change than my last switch from iPhone 5 to 6s.

Residents of Tecoaque, also known as Zultepec, captured a convoy of about 15 male Spaniards, 50 women and 10 children, 45 foot soldiers who included Cubans of African and Indigenous descent, and about 350 allies from Indigenous groups in 1520.

> The rupee (INR) lost about one-third of a per cent last session as it closed at 73.28 versus Friday's close of 73.06 against the dollar (USD). The local currency begun Monday's session with a gap-down and was unable to recover intraday. Also, it closed below the support of 73.25, a bearish indication. Following this, INR opened with gap-up today at 73.17, thereby going back above the support of 73.25. But unless, it rallies past the resistance of 73.15, the recovery can be shaky and the domestic unit could witness fresh selling.

> The year 2020 was, without a doubt, a breakthrough for streaming, the pandemic keeping large numbers of people home for a lot more time than usual. In addition, new services arrived in 2020, including HBO Max and Peacock, while Disney+ and Apple TV+ built up their offerings throughout the year after debuting in late 2019. Netflix, meanwhile, had a string of huge hits throughout 2020, from Tiger King to The Queen's Gambit.  The streaming hub Reelgood this week put out a new report called Q4 2020 VOD Streaming Report, which was based on what the company called its 'VOD Viewing Insights,' which come from thirty-two million interactions from two million users.

> Does anyone have the new SE with the apple smart battery case? I'm looking for REAL WORLD usage from this combo. Due to some unfortunate eye strain and headache issues, I can't use an oled iPhone or even the xr/11. Will the se be different is something I don't know. My 8+ is cracked and barely holding on. The battery is still 97%, but the rest of it is in rough shape after I dropped it (first phone I have ever broken) I'm aware the new se battery life is horrible. I have never owned an apple battery case, but I'm curious how much this actually extends the battery in real world usage.

The quantity and quality of the new hires has caused a stir in the tight-knit cloud community, and could indicate that Apple is finally getting serious about building tech infrastructure on par with companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

Considering how durable the AirPods Pro and their case actually are, the Spigen Tough Armor case feels like absolute overkill. And yet, when you consider the price of these compact earbuds, it doesn't seem unreasonable to add an extra layer of protection in the case of a particularly nasty drop. The added bulk of the Tough Armor's air-cushioned corners might make the AirPods Pro charge case a little harder to fit into your pocket but you can't complain too much when it still works with wireless charging.

While the company had made its name as the designer for wireless charging technologies for consumer electronics, over the past two years the company was shifting its focus to more industrial applications. So it made sense to work with the Indian company on new form factors and applications for its charging technologies.

Two conflicting narratives have materialized since the first cases were detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan a year ago, exposing a deep chasm between researchers exploring COVID-19's beginnings.

The show, which will feature Jeremy Renner reprising his role as Clint Barton from the Avengers movies, sees the superhero teaming up with a new archer, known as Kate Bishop (who's officially being played by Bumblebee's Hailee Steinfeld). This has been a long time coming – Hawkeye is the only one of the original Avengers never to have a solo movie, at this point, and a TV show that introduces an understudy of sorts to the Marvel Cinematic Universe feels like something that hasn't been done yet.

So, if you're on the physical version and want to switch to digital instead, you should be able to do that without a hitch. Unlike other Nintendo systems, your game save data for the Switch is stored on the console's system memory, not on the cartridge. Even if you buy the digital version and later archive or delete the game from your console, your game saves will be preserved.

The greenhouse gas would be captured from coal-fired power plants, keeping it out of the atmosphere where it causes global warming. The captured gas would instead be pumped underground to add pressure to and boost production from oil fields. In all, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management designated 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) of federal land for pipeline development through the Wyoming Pipeline Corridor Initiative, the Casper Star-Tribune reported.

But it does have its limitations, including limited storage and glove operation requiring physical keys. But it's still a decent option that will suffice for many field workers. From $392 at Amazon Slightly lighter in weight Available at a discount now that Active3 is out Super rugged design Not high-res screen No touch sensitivity with gloves Not a lot of storage space The Active3 offers some interesting upgrades compared to the Active2, including the new Android OS, a higher-resolution screen, longer battery life, enhanced shock absorption, support for a No Battery Mode, Samsung DeX integration capabilities, and Google ARCore support for enabling AR services like remote training.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo SYDNEY (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google said on Friday it would block its search engine in Australia if the government proceeds with a new code that would force it and Facebook Inc to pay media companies for the right to use their content. Google's threat escalates a battle with publishers such as News Corp that is being closely watched around the world. The search giant had warned that its 19 million Australian users would face degraded search and YouTube experiences if the new code were enforced.

> Camp Cretaceous Season 1 was pretty good. The animated Jurassic World series, which kicked off on Netflix last September, has a lucky group of teenagers trying out a new adventure camp on Isla Nublar before it opens up to the public. However, after the dinosaurs get loose and the campers get separated from their counselors, the gang is forced to survive while they search for a way off the island. This time around, the plot — now with a clear trajectory — takes hold. The opening season thrived on its fun setting and just-scary-enough action, however, many of the characters felt especially geared toward a young crowd.

'As members of the writing and publishing community of the United States, we affirm that participation in the administration of Donald Trump must be considered a uniquely mitigating criterion for publishing houses when considering book deals,' said professors in an open letter.

> On January 20, and as expected, NASA's now-former administrator Jim Bridenstine stepped down from his role. Soon after, the Biden administration announced that NASA's Steve Jurczyk, who has been with the space agency for decades, will serve as acting administrator until a permanent replacement is found. This news isn't a surprise — Bridenstine said shortly after the presidential election that he would step down from his role as NASA administrator even if the Biden administration asked him to remain.

Biden faces two main problems: how to punish Russia, if at all; and how to fully kick its hackers out of U.S. networks, a process that experts say will take months at least. Democrats who watched Donald Trump as president consistently defer to Russian President Vladimir Putin are eager to take a stronger stance.

> The names of the five experts judging Facebook's decision to suspend President Donald Trump will be kept secret as allies and opponents of the former president gear up for a pressure campaign. The Facebook Oversight Board, an independent "supreme court" set up by the social media giant to review its decisions, confirmed on Thursday that it will not disclose the identities of the board members charged with hearing Mr Trump's case . A spokesman said that the five case panellists, whose ruling must be confirmed by the full board, will remain anonymous in order to protect them from security threats and attempts at lobbying them individually, as is the board's policy for all cases.

SpaceX's rocket has a relatively high payload capacity compared to the size of many of the small satellites produced today, so a rideshare mission like this offers smaller companies and startups a chance to get their spacecraft in orbit without breaking the bank. The cargo capsule atop the Falcon 9 flying today holds a total of 133 satellites according to SpaceX, which is a new record for the highest number of satellites being launched on a single rocket – beating out a payload of 104 spacecraft delivered by Indian Space Research Organization's PSLV-C37 launch back in February 2017.

> Britains biggest microchip factory plans to cash in on a global semiconductor shortage by raising more than £50m in an effort to nearly double production. Newport Wafer Fab, in South Wales, said it would use the investment to raise production levels to 14,000 wafers a week, up from 8,000 today. It follows record orders for the company's power supply chips, which are in demand from the car industry amid an intense supply shortage that has seen several car companies suspend production. The company, which has around 450 employees, is the biggest of a cluster of chip makers around Cardiff.

> Fauna has hit the market with their own version of Bose Frame-like audio sunglasses and fashion glasses, and we took a look at them to see if they're worth the price.Audio eyewear may sound strange to some, but for others, it's a game-changer. For example — if you're a parent to a young child, sitting around your home with earphones in may prevent you from hearing your child getting into something they shouldn't. Or maybe you like to listen to music while riding your bike — if you wear audio eyewear, your ears are left open to hear potential danger, but you can still enjoy your favorite podcasts or audiobooks.

The IRS may also have erred on the other side, sending relief payments to some who didn't actually qualify for the check, or for the total they may've received.

> Telecom companies were expected to be the next superstars a few years ago. That was until a handful of bad business decisions and recent circumstances set in. From 2015 onward, Nic Fildes of FT writes, "The value of listed telecoms companies has dropped almost 20% on average over the past year, continuing a downward spiral." Then came the pandemic, which was supposed to serve telecom companies as an opportunity to reverse this trend. Hopes ran especially high for European telecoms, which suffered through acquisitions years earlier that brought on debt and didn't boost their value as anticipated.

If you want a distro to be like Windows, why not just use Windows?But there are (presumably) some things that Windows does right and perhaps it would be nice if a distro did just a couple of such things. In fact, the ReactOS team have for the last ten years dedicated themselves to recreating the Win32 API in Linux, so if you need low-level compatibility you should check that out.Musing on Microsoft-ian merits aside, Linuxfx is a distro by Brazilian developer Rafael Rachid.

Unfortunately, you can't pin it to the menu bar like you can in Windows, where you might pin an app to the Start menu or the Quick Launch bar. You can pin it to the Dock, but the menu bar, sorry, is out of bounds.Luckily there's a free and lightweight app that lets us customize that menu bar to our heart's content — or, pin icons from our favorite apps, files, and folders to it, anyway. It's not the easiest thing to do and you should plan to devote a little bit of time to it, but if pinning files and folders to the menu bar is important to you then it's worth putting in a little bit of time.

At the time, what we now know as Covid-19, had killed just nine people and infected 400 others. More than a year later, the hermit kingdom's border remains sealed tight shut.This story originally appeared on WIRED UK. North Korea's response to the pandemic has been one of the most extreme and paranoid in the world, experts say. The lockdowns and quarantines it has imposed have been strict, while border restrictions have put a halt to fishing and the smuggling of goods into the country.

Weather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore was outside reporting on the blizzard when a sudden purple flash illuminated the sky. "Oh yes! We got it baby!" he yelled, repeatedly leaping in the air. The "it" was thundersnow -- the relatively rare, sometimes unnerving, sometimes thrilling appearance of lightning and thunder during a snowstorm. The scarcity of thundersnow events, while likely compounding the delight of weather lovers who experience them, has also meant that scientists don't understand thundersnow as well as traditional summertime thunderstorms.

> In a cancer diagnosis, family members have delicate and difficult moments when specialists cannot reach consensus on the results of a beloved family member. Distress, grief and concern are complicated by the necessities of caregiving. Family caregivers can lose as many as 10 years of their lives and about $660,000  over a lifetime.  This has worsened  since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, where schools and child care centers are closed and many families have to take care of children, as well as sick and elder adults at home.

[You should hold off on buying an SSD for PS5. Here's why!](https://www.androidcentral.com/should-i-buy-replacement-ssd-ps5)


> Source: Nick Sutrich / Android CentralBest answer: No. Sony has not stated which internal SSDs will be compatible just yet and the PS5 does not support expanded internal storage at the moment. Only buy an external SSD if you're looking to store and play your backward-compatible PS4 games. To make it as simple as possible: SSDs are much faster, usually smaller, and cost more than HDDs. This is because SSDs use flash storage to read and write information while HDDs have mechanical parts that physically read and write information.

We had GameStop, Best Buy and Target all offering more chances to buy PS5 in the US, with Currys and Game offering UK shoppers a console as well. All of those PS5 restocks did sell out fairly quickly, however retailers were releasing stock in waves this time around making for a slightly more even playing field. We're yet to hear much from the likes of Amazon and Walmart in the US, and the UK is still waiting on more stock from Amazon and Argos as well - so there's still plenty to play for in this round of stock.

> Back at CES 2021, Nvidia announced its RTX 3000 laptop graphics processors, powering a whole new generation of the best gaming laptops. At first glance, this new lineup is pretty easy to follow, as the three GPUs on offer are the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 - three desktop graphics cards that dropped in 2020.However, as always, the constraints of a mobile form factor mean that you're not exactly getting the same graphics card as the name implies. For the most part, this isn't really a big deal - it's a bit silly to expect that a laptop is going to be able to provide the same amount of raw horsepower that a full desktop system with unlimited power and cooling can offer.

> The number of girls unhappy with their appearance doubles by the age of 14 due to 'heavy social media use', researchers have found.  Research from the Education Policy Institute (EPI) and the Prince's Trust found that wellbeing and self-esteem are similar in boys and girls at the end of primary school. However, while both decline, girls see a far greater decrease by the age of 14. It also found that, while around one in seven girls (15 per cent) report being unhappy with the way they look at the end of primary school, this almost doubles and rises to nearly one in three (29 per cent) by age 14.

> If you want an Apple-branded external display, your sole option nowadays is the $5999 Pro Display XDR. To make matters worse, Apple also deprecated Target Display Mode, which allowed people to use their iMac as an external display for another computer. Nonetheless, these roadblocks didn't stop one developer from creating a one-of-a-kind 5K iMac Display. Developer Phillip Caudell took to Twitter last week to showcase the 5K iMac Display, which is sort of a 'Frankenstein of parts.' Essentially, Phillip was able to track down an old iMac housing, then buy the exact panel that Apple uses in the iMac on eBay: It's a bit of a Frankenstein of parts: I picked up an old iMac housing for £20 (and scooted across London with it like a prat).

Thousands of small retail investors, organizing through online forums like Reddit's 'WallStreetBets' board, are locked in a battle with hedge funds this week. The retail investors are backing stocks that have been heavily shorted by hedge funds, most notably GameStop ($GME) but also AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), and Nokia ($NOK).

> Beating Wall Street4 Things to KnowUnderstanding Stock OptionsThis week, the biggest story in the financial markets is the absurdist, pretty-sure-I-hallucinated-it drama involving GameStop, a struggling video-game retailer that became the rope in a high-stakes tug of war between Wall Street suits and a crusading internet mob.The simplest explanation for what happened is that a bunch of hyper-online mischief-makers in Reddit's r/WallStreetBets forum — a clan of self-described degenerates with user names like 'dumbledoreRothIRA' and 'Coldcutcombo69' — decided it would be funny and righteous (and maybe even profitable, though that part was less important) to execute a 'short squeeze' by pushing up the price of GameStop's stock, entrapping the big-money hedge funds that had bet against it.

But the all-in-one solution of a soundbar is the simplest way to boost your audio experience. Plus, soundbars today rival the output of surround sound systems.

> NEW YORK -- It's not just you. What's going on with GameStop's stock doesn't make sense to a lot of people. The struggling video game retailer's stock has been making stupefying moves this month, wild enough to raise concerns from professional investors on Wall Street to the hallways of regulators and the White House in Washington. The frenzy hit new heights Thursday when several trading platforms limited their customers from making certain trades with GameStop. It's all forcing hard questions about whether the stock market is in a dangerous bubble and whether a new generation of traders should be allowed to take full advantage of all the tools and free trades available on their phones, regardless of how reckless they may seem to outsiders.

Thank heavens.  Wombats' odd poop has long been a curious and fun animal fact. And the answer behind it isn't as simple as "square-shaped butthole." OK, not quite that simple anyway. Basically: the Rubik's-esque scat is formed in wombats' intestines via muscle contractions and not at the point of exit.  Researchers from Georgia Tech and the University of Tasmania published their findings this week in a journal — I shit you not — called Soft Matter.

Thanks to the encroaching release of the new RTX 3000 cards, slightly older (but still powerful) machines are now being driven down in price - just like this MSI GF65 Leopard going for $769 (was $1,249) at Newegg after rebate.With a GTX 1660Ti graphics card, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and Intel Core i7-10750H processor, this MSI is incredibly well specced out for such a cheap gaming laptop deal. For 1080p gaming, it's going to perform well for the price, and while that GTX card might be getting a little older now, it should still keep up for medium settings on the newest games for quite some time.

> Water scarcity is among the top five global risks affecting people's wellbeing. In water-scarce areas, the situation is grim. Conventional sources like snowfall, rainfall, river runoff, and easily accessible groundwater are being affected by climate change, and supplies are shrinking as demand grows. In these countries, water is a critical challenge to sustainable development and a potential cause of social unrest and conflict. Water scarcity also impacts traditional seasonal human migration routes and, together with other water insecurity factors, could reshape migration patterns.

Price: Wireless gaming headsets are always more expensive than wired headsets. Their ease of use and the ability to move around untethered to your console is a sought after feature that demands expensive hardware that raises the price. With this in mind, the Sony PS5 Pulse 3D Wireless Headset is surprisingly affordable at NZ$180.

Eventually, we're able to place ourselves in 1920s New York, and pinpoint Irene (Tessa Thompson) as our protagonist.  But the disorientation of those first moments never quite fades. Though it's based on a 1929 novella by Nella Larsen, and shot in the elegant black-and-white and boxy 4:3 aspect ratio of classic Hollywood, Passing feels thoroughly modern in its exploration of the blurred lines demarcating race, class, gender, and sexuality.

> Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman will command an all-civilian space mission to orbit. (SpaceX Photo) A billionaire CEO who also happens to be a trained jet pilot is buying a days-long flight to orbit aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft — and he's setting aside the three other seats for a health care worker, a sweepstakes prize winner and the top tech contestant in a 'Shark Tank'-style competition. That means you, too, could fly to space if you're lucky, or a techie. Jared Isaacman, the 37-year-old founder and CEO of Pennsylvania-based Shift4 Payments , will command the Inspiration4 mission , which is due for launch as early as this year and is currently due to last two to four days.

> By Ben Darling, Country Manager for ANZ, Stratasys:   It's no surprise that 3D printing has forced several industries to change, and as the technology advances, its impact ripples outward into new areas. Much of the improvement exhibited by the 3D printing sector concerns the cost of obtaining and using a 3D printer, with $100 printers now empowering hobbyists at any level to become a 'maker' themselves. This disruption in the age-old manufacturing dynamic, whereby factories are the exclusive makers of goods, has now spread to the packaging sector as 3D printers also set their sights on the wrapping and boxing that these goods arrive in.

> By now, you've probably read all the headlines and maybe even a few news stories about Jeff Bezos stepping down from his throne as CEO of Amazon to serve as its executive chairman instead. Bezos released a letter explaining the move that I retained absolutely none of — mostly because I got bored halfway through. In it, he mentions that as executive chair, he'll "stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives" and intends "to focus [his] energies and attention on new products and early initiatives." Of course, he left out the only tidbit of information I was interested in; the reason I read the letter to begin with: an explanation as to why he decided to make the switch.

> On Tuesday the world's second richest person said he intended to leave his role as Amazon CEO behind and morph into something, we presume, more powerful in the form of the Executive Chair of the Amazon Board. So, in honor of the news, here's Jeff Bezos as Amazon scandals (a thread):  1. Amazon fires 2 workers who publicly criticized warehouse conditions 2. Ring admits its employees tried to access customers' private video 3. Report: Amazon thought using third-party delivery drivers was dangerous, but did it anyway 4.

> After 26 years and $1.7 trillion dollars, Jeff Bezos' time as CEO of Amazon is coming to an end.  The person who broke records as the richest person the world had ever seen (though he currently sits in the number two spot, behind Elon Musk), Bezos announced in a blog post Tuesday that he would be stepping down from his CEO role later in 2021. Current head of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will be taking over, though Bezos will still reign as the Executive Chair of the Amazon Board. Bezos is a polarizing figure, to say the least.

The new procedures are part of the company's efforts to advance media literacy among TikTok users, said Jamie Favazza, TikTok's director of communications for policy and safety. They go into effect in the U.S. and Canada immediately. TikTok videos are usually fact-checked when they're flagged by users for misinformation or when they're related to Covid-19, vaccines, elections or other topics about which the spread of misleading information is common, Favazza said.

[Does ExpressVPN work with Apple TV?](https://www.imore.com/does-expressvpn-work-apple-tv)

It takes a little bit of trickery within your ExpressVPN and Apple TV settings, but you can use the service specifically for bypassing geographic content restrictions. Alternatively, set ExpressVPN up on your compatible router. Using a VPN on your Mac, iPad or iPhone has become pretty commonplace and it's super-easy to get set up with a service like ExpressVPN on these devices. Unlike macOS and iOS devices, the Apple TV doesn't have a dedicated way to connect to a VPN service which makes the process a little more tricky, though not impossible.

[Biden nominee suggests no change in US Huawei stance](https://www.techradar.com/news/biden-nominee-suggests-no-change-in-us-huawei-stance)


> (Image credit: Future) Hopes that Joe Biden's tenure as US president would lead to a reprieve for Huawei appear to be unfounded following comments from his nominee for commerce secretary.Huawei, along with several other Chinese companies, has been on the US ‘non-entity' list since 2019, a status that prevents US companies from doing business with it without a licence. This has limited its access to key technologies such as Google applications and US-manufactured components.Gina Raimondo had initially not committed to keeping Huawei on the list, prompting senate republicans to seek a delay to her confirmation until the matter was clarified.

It also keeps it nice and cool while gaming, which is great since the TUF is relatively thin for a gaming laptop.

[HP Pavilion Gaming laptop review: Plays harder than its price](https://www.cnet.com/reviews/hp-pavilion-gaming-2018-review/)


> The Pavilion Gaming Laptop isn't as aggressive or cutting-edge as  HP's Omen gaming line , though that's sort of the point. The PC maker promotes it as a solid, reliable laptop for gaming and everyday tasks and it definitely lives up to that.  You won't find the latest Nvidia RTX graphics chips inside, and it doesn't have gaming extras such as RGB LED keyboard lighting or GPU overclocking . What you do get is snappy multitasking and gaming performance and a design that stands out from the run-of-the-mill.

> Lori Grunin/CNET The ThinkPad X1 Extreme isn't the first Lenovo with discrete graphics or even the first mainstream ThinkPad with it: the 15-inch  Yoga 720 launched with an Nvidia GTX 1050 option and the T series has had an option for Nvidia's mobile graphics solution, the MX150, for a little while. But the X1 Extreme is the first of its top-end ThinkPad X1 line of business laptops with the option to combine a GTX 1050 Ti Max-Q with the bright, wide-gamut 4K screen that  debuted earlier this year .

Sarah Tew/CNET The $1.9 trillion stimulus package, and its third stimulus check of up to $1,400, took another step forward Friday on the path to becoming reality. First, Senate and then House Democrats set up the pieces that will allow them to leapfrog Republicans, using a powerful move to cut out the opposition and more quickly approve the bill -- and the stimulus check -- along partisan lines. Still unknown, however, is how Congress could target the stimulus checks to cut out higher earners.

It all started when the Sesame Street star launched into a Twitter thread running through some of his international relatives. See, the educational kid's series is an international phenomenon. But because the show covers the basics — our ABCs and 123s — a version written for U.S. children won't really be helpful in other parts of the world. So there are multiple versions of the show, each with their own title and cast of characters.

That's why you won't be shocked to see that Sony's new flagship midsize Vaio is more than simply another slim clamshell. The Vaio Flip 15 still faces the same question that has bedeviled other hybrids before: How do you solve the age-old (or at least a few years old) problem of building a tablet and laptop into a single device? We've certainly seen plenty of possible solutions over the years, from fully detachable screens, to slide-out keyboards, to screens that twist or rotate around, but there's still room for improvement.

> Apple is widely believed to be preparing to launch a new podcasts subscription service, according to a variety of reports. Apple already has a popular Podcasts app and maintains a podcast distribution service on its Mac and iOS platforms, but the company has attempted to monetize it to date. By creating a paid podcasting service, Apple could potentially lure podcast creators with the promise of increased profits, stealing them away from other platforms like Spotify, SiriusXM, and Amazon. A recent report by Loup Ventures analysts made the case for a new Apple service tentatively titled "Podcasts+.

As I was looking it over, I noticed a white paste like substance around the screen and into the vent area. I also noticed that the screen didn't have the nice glossy look to It like my 2012 MBP, it was a smudged/matte look. I messaged the guy and he told me that the white substance 'was from the glass cleaner that he used On it. The same as a glass top stove'. 🤦 WTF?!?!? Really? Anyways, is the screen actually glass? Or is it plastic? Does anyone know if the scratch removers work? Is there something else I could do? Or are we looking at getting the screen replaced? Thanks for your time.

> © Provided by The Edge Many parties have complained about the lack of technology talent in Malaysia. Some attribute this problem to universities, saying they fail to equip students with the latest skills. However, the pace of technological development is rapid, and universities need time to update or introduce new courses, which also require approval from the government. This can take a long time, which is another grouse that some industry players have. What can be done to ensure that universities in Malaysia can generate enough talented graduates to support the tech industry? Given how quickly digital technologies develop, it is quite likely that by the time students graduate from their three-year courses, the content would already be outdated, says Datuk Dr Parmjit Singh, CEO of Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation and president of the Malaysian Association of Private Colleges and Universities.

At the height of his popularity, Kilroy could be found just about everywhere: in bathrooms and on bridges, in school cafeterias and on homework assignments, in the holds of Navy ships and painted on the shells of Air Force missiles. A classic Bugs Bunny cartoon from 1948, "Haredevil Hare," shows just how deeply Kilroy had penetrated into pop culture: thinking he's the first rabbit to land on the moon, Bugs is oblivious to the slogan "Kilroy was here" prominently etched on a rock behind him.

With revised looks and a less funky vibe, the underdog SUV hits dealers soon with a starting price of $24,590.Now, the low price doesn't get you a lot of the goods other Eclipse Cross models carry. Specifically, the $24,590 price, which includes a $1,195 destination charge, nets buyers an ES trim that lacks the brand's updated infotainment system with 8-inch display.

> Earlier this month, I was changing lanes on Bay Area highways with just the push of a turn signal in a Cadillac Escalade with the latest version of Super Cruise.  I didn't have to check my blind spot or quickly accelerate to get over. The massive SUV did all that for me once its cameras, radars, and sensing equipment determined it was safe to do so. Once centered in the new lane I turned the indicator off, put my hands back in my lap, and the car continued to drive me along. Super Cruise is a driver assistance technology that's been available in certain Cadillac models since 2017 and is coming to more GM cars in the future, with 22 vehicle types slated to be equipped with the hands-free driving system by 2023.

For years, gamer culture—the toxic parts of it, at least—insisted on gatekeeping, on maintaining that games be difficult and complex to restrict 'filthy casuals' from entering the fray. But as casual players have grown in numbers, it's become harder for gamers, and game companies, to ignore them. It's understandable that studios want to appeal to a certain type of player—especially when the developers and writers at those studios are creating the kind of game they themselves want to enjoy.

In 2019, Facebook paid £3m to charity to settle a defamation lawsuit from the financial journalist Martin Lewis after more than 1,000 scam adverts using his face and name.

Any violation of customer data protection rules would pile more pressure on the local technology companies, already dealing with heightened regulatory scrutiny after years of a laissez-faire approach.

But there was little research to back that up. Now, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science, suggests that diversity in law enforcement can indeed lead to improvements in how police treat people of color. 'It's a system that very clearly needs reforming,' said University of Pennsylvania data scientist Dean Knox, a co-author of the study.

Houston's very own Intuitive Machines is hoping to be the first commercial company to bring NASA payloads to the lunar surface through their Nova-C Lunar Lander. 'A payload is an instrument or a scientific package that's meant to go to the moon and collect scientific data so that we can understand the moon better," Intuitive Machines Vice President for Control Centers Dr. Troy LeBlanc said. But LeBlanc said none of that can be done without first building the new Nova Control command center.

> Keeping your kids safe on the internet isn't easy and standard parental control filters can be cumbersome to manage. Your Wi-Fi router may come with some rudimentary built-in blocking capabilities, but it likely won't equip a lot of fine-grained control. On the other hand, software solutions may only be compatible with certain devices. That's why a few brands have released new devices that apply complex rules network-wide, allowing you to block sites, set screen time limits and monitor activity on any device you have at home.

I've actually used this in a gesture recognition project and you can check that out here. The idea is to capture the background and then comparing the captured frame to each new frame. Each pixel that is close enough to the background frame will be subtracted, and each different pixel will be kept. Method 2 The second method uses a deep neural network that performs image segmentation on each frame of video.

After listing on the OTC markets last year, the UK.-listed blockchain mining company has seen shares rise from $0.17 to $2.72 — a stunning 1,500% return. The reason for the outsized returns is simple: cryptocurrency miners have incredibly high operating leverage. That means the doubling in Bitcoin prices since late last year will increase mining profitability by an even greater magnitude.

Most of you already know the history behind this, but for anyone referred here by NYT, this is where I give my side and defend myself. Like many people in the early 2000s, I started a blog when I was in college. To stay anonymous, I wrote it under my first and middle names – Scott Alexander – while leaving out my last name. I continued writing in it through medical school, residency, and until the present. Although I've never personally been involved in the tech industry, my blog became very popular among people in tech because it discussed ideas centering around scientific and technological progress, especially artificial intelligence.

"EUV" stands for "electric utility vehicle" which is Chevy's play on SUV as it markets a tougher, heftier EV. The Bolt EV came out in 2017 as the first all-electric vehicle from General Motors, which now plans to produce only EVs by 2035 .

The strength of Earth's magnetic field would have almost vanished during the event, called the Laschamp excursion, which lasted a few thousand years.

Its successor, the OnePlus 9, along with two other models are expected to be released in March, and with only a month to go, there is much speculation about what the phone will look like. So far we've seen leaked specs and a few sneak peeks at what the OnePlus 9 could look like, but very little when it comes to confirmed details. We expect OnePlus to reveal more about its new flagship phone closer to the time, but here is everything we know so far on the price, specs and latest news and rumours about that highly-anticipated release date.

> Facebook's decision to ban media organizations from posting links to news articles on the social media giant's platform comes less than a week before Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout begins. The ban also prevented many health organizations, government health departments, and other organizations from posting links (some, but not all, have now been restored). The combined effect of this could be incredibly damaging. My research is on how poor-quality information and misinformation in online environments, including social media, is presenting serious challenges for public health.

Here are the details so far: According to William Easton, managing director at Facebook Australia & New Zealand, Australian publishers are restricted from sharing or posting any content on Facebook pages. Page administrators will still be able to access other features, including Page Insights and Creator Studio, as well as data tools and CrowdTangle. This means users in and out of the country cannot view or share Australian news content on Facebook or content from Australian news pages.

> Facebook has blocked Australian users from sharing and viewing news content on its popular social media platform, escalating a dispute with the government over paying media publishers for content. While Big Tech and media outlets have battled over the right to news content in other jurisdictions, Australia's looming law represents the most expansive reform and is being closely watched around the world. The so-called Media Bargaining Code has been designed by the government and competition regulator to address a power imbalance between the social media giants and publishers when negotiating payment for news content used on the tech firms' sites.

Facebook said the ban was a direct response to the federal government's news media code legislation, which is expected to become law soon and would require digital platforms such as Facebook and Google to pay news media companies whose content they host. The move is either a last-ditch attempt to gain concessions in the legislation, or a simple cut-and-run by Facebook.

He would burst into screams, and we'd scramble to get a bottle prepared/warmed. However there wasn't a very good way to know how much milk to warm (once you heat it, it has to be either consumed or discarded). And since a bottle takes 5+ minutes to heat up, we'd spend that time fumbling to soothe him until it was ready. After one-to-two weeks of this, I decided to do something about it.

[Android 12 Developer Preview Now Available For Android TV](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/02/android-12-developer-preview-android-tv)


> In addition to releasing the Android 12 Developer Preview for smartphones and tablets, the preview is also available for Android TV.This is actually quite a bit surprising, since Android TV doesn't typically get the developer preview on the same day. It's typically a few months later on. And the final release is also usually much later on. Perhaps, we'll be seeing a more uniform release among all Android device types this year.There's not a lot of details on what's new with Android 12 for Android TV, however, Google does mention that developers can test their Android TV apps on Android 12, and also test it on the all-new Google TV experience.

[Here's The First Developer Preview Of Android 12!](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/02/android-12-developer-preview-1-release)


> Google has just released the first developer preview for Android 12.As usual, this is a developer preview, and meant only for developers. And not to be used on your main device. That is because it is still full of bugs and broken features. Basically, it's pretty rough, so if you have a second phone, then you can put the preview on your Pixel and play around with it, but we wouldn't recommend putting it on your main phone.What's new with Android 12?With the first developer preview being geared towards developers, the majority of the features being announced (right now) are developer features.

So the world must make dramatic changes to society, economics and daily life, a new United Nations report says. Unlike past U.N. reports that focused on one issue and avoided telling leaders actions to take, Thursday's report combines three intertwined environment crises and tells the world what's got to change. It calls for changing what governments tax, how nations value economic output, how power is generated, the way people get around, fish and farm, as well as what they eat.

> This has become increasingly important as more people use companies like Facebook as a source for news. In the UK, over a third of people regularly get their news from Facebook, meaning that rather than viewing it on news websites or on broadcast channels or buying a newspaper, they principally get it through social media. News publishers make no or very little money from this, so the Australian Government is requesting that companies like Facebook, make a contribution back for content they themselves make money out of, so that content has got a sustainable future.

> In the wave of imitators to Dark Souls that have released over the last decade, Team Ninja's 2017 hit Nioh stood out as perhaps the best attempt at replicating FromSoftware's formula. While not strictly mimicking every mechanic and idea, it nonetheless captured the same intensity with its combat and intrigue with its level design that mixed historical facts with mythological fiction. It also saw Team Ninja recover from the loss of Itagaki in 2008 (a departure that haunted the company for nearly a decade) by making possibly the best game in its storied history.

> When Reliance Jio started building its 4G LTE wireless network, it had the option of using a standard map to decide things such as the customers it will reach out to and places where it will set up its towers. This manual process would have taken several quarters before it could have been streamlined. In order to get going as fast and with as much precision as possible, it built maps based on a geographic information system. While Jio Maps helped find the best sites to set up towers for optimum coverage, Jio used the tool to coordinate materials for just-in-time deliveries and dispatch teams for network construction.

The French term itself might come off as intimidating and best suited for a professional chef, but the "under vacuum" technique is actually much easier than you'd think—especially when it has a smart touch to it. All you need is one of the best smart sous vide machines, also called an immersion circulator, which will heat a water bath to a precise temperature. Food that is vacuum-sealed or placed in airtight bags is submerged into this water, which circulates and slowly cooks food until it reaches the desired temperature.

The feature was already available in iOS. As per XDADevelopers, Google is adding a new streaming option to YouTube on Android devices.

> Japanese contractor Taisei Corp has developed a technology to convert carbon dioxide, a common greenhouse gas, emitted at manufacturing plants into a building material. The company aims to commercialize concrete made with CO2-infused calcium and blast furnace slag, a byproduct from steel production, by around 2030. The process eliminates the use of cement, a key ingredient in concrete and a major source of CO2 emission. Taisei said its new method will be carbon negative.

> Events in Australia are catalysing an overdue conversation: how best to preserve a faltering access to a reliable way of learning about the ever-changing world or, in a word, news. Producing reliable, high-quality news has never been cheap and ever since technology firms became the mediators between producers and consumers of news, traditional media companies have found themselves increasingly cut off from their main source of revenue: advertising. Australia's recourse is a law that will require foreign tech companies, specifically Facebook and Google, to pay for news content that appears on their websites.

> From the day The Lincoln Project launched in late 2019 as a group of high-profile Republicans determined to take down then-President Donald Trump, the super PAC positioned itself as a moral authority on the fate of the country.  "As Americans, we must stem the damage he and his followers are doing to the rule of law, the Constitution and the American character," the project's co-founders wrote in a New York Times op-ed. So when it recently became public that 21 men accused co-founder John Weaver of online sexual harassment, and that its leaders allegedly knew about some of those complaints as early as last March, The Lincoln Project swiftly lost its credibility.

This was known as the "Windows tax," the extra money you paid for an operating system you didn't need. About 15 years ago, pioneering companies like System76 began selling white-label hardware with Linux preinstalled, along with all the necessary drivers to ensure hardware compatibility. Linux worked out of the box. They were seldom what you'd call svelte laptops, but they were solid machines, and hey, no Windows tax.

It is also home to some pretty good Pokemon designs. Since Generation VI, Pokemon has focused on smaller Pokedexes with less Pokemon, and Alola fits that description well. It is also the first time since Generation V that Game Freak went more thematic with the Pokemon designs, creating monsters that fit the Hawaiian-based setting.

> (Image credit: LG) Yet another rumor suggests that the LG Rollable may have been delayed, if not cancelled outright. LG has allegedly told its suppliers, including those providing displays, that the rollable project has been put on hold, according to Yonhap News.The Rollable was dramatically unveiled at the online-only CES 2021, and subsequently confirmed a 2021 release date – but weeks later, we heard that the device might be cancelled. These uneven rumors make us wonder if the LG Rollable is coming out this year after all.
