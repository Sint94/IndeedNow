Of course, this time the Steelers won't be resting their first-string starters like QB Ben Roethlisberger and will be pushing themselves to the limit this time. Also coming off a restful weekend for the Steelers will be J.J. Watt and Cam Howard. Even without several impactful starters, Pittsburgh still nearly beat the Browns. It's optimistic to assume Cleveland will be moving on past week 18.

"Now, that means that if you have an underlying health condition that increases your risk of Covid and you're 25, it has to be approaching an increased risk of 100 fold to overcome the protective effects of age," said Mr Brown According to the scientist, people with rare illnesses who are particularly at risk can access an early vaccine under exceptional circumstances.

> Dec 14, 2019 232 398 Berlin I've been using Time Machine since day 1 with .Mac and iCloud and could always recover lost Contacts, emails, etc within Core Apps. Now you cannot open Contacts or Mail to recover individual contacts or emails, etc. Many of us have filed bug reports with Apple since this began with Catalina. Initially it was an acknowledged bug, now Apple claims recovery is only possible with a full restore of Mail, Contacts, etc. which defeats one of the great features of Time Machine.

> Is the Keyboard Mechanism on the M1 MacBookAir and MacBookPro identical? I know the layout of the keys is different, but I want to know about the mechanism (ie: the typing experience, key travel, etc) between the two. Apple's description says the Air now has a Scissor mechanism, but doesn't specify if it is identical to the Pro or not. (Apple "specialists" I asked were unhelpful...) Thanks...
