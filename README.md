> In a rematch of week 17, Cleveland heads to Pittsburgh to try and beat the Steelers for a second time in a row to advance in the playoffs. Of course, this time the Steelers won't be resting their first-string starters like QB Ben Roethlisberger and will be pushing themselves to the limit this time. Also coming off a restful weekend for the Steelers will be J.J. Watt and Cam Howard. Even without several impactful starters, Pittsburgh still nearly beat the Browns. It's optimistic to assume Cleveland will be moving on past week 18.

In this case, it was the safety and well-being— physical and otherwise—of our loved ones and our communities. But now, the connotations of safety have broadened because the pandemic has caused more people and devices to be connected digitally than ever before.

> Although multiple datasets were used to create vaccination strategy, QCovid and another dataset called OpenSAFELY were the main resources used to inform JCVI's advice to government, according to Brown.  The datasets found that a 70-year-old is 100 times more likely to die than somebody under the age of 39. "Now, that means that if you have an underlying health condition that increases your risk of Covid and you're 25, it has to be approaching an increased risk of 100 fold to overcome the protective effects of age," said Mr Brown According to the scientist, people with rare illnesses who are particularly at risk can access an early vaccine under exceptional circumstances.
