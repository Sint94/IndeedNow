> Yes, there were some great phones that came out in 2020. But it was still a boring year for smartphones, with very few companies pushing the envelope on new ideas. If there was an exception, it was the LG Wing, a device with a literal twist on how we view smartphones.

> Hi Folks, i‘ve just gotten my 2012 MacBook air back from my daughter, she's gone ipad, and I'm really struggling with it. I gave this to my daughter about 4 years ago when I went all in on the iPad myself, it I loved it at the time. When I was using it I had all my mail accounts, notifications for Facebook messenger and it ran for me just like my iPad does now. I know it's old machine but since I reset it and upgraded to Mojave it's shockingly good for a 9 year old computer. I only want to use it now in my shed and should've just been happy with an internet and YouTube machine, but hey🤷🏼‍♂️, now it's up and running I want it back the way it was.
