Essentially, Apple Music HiFi will provide a high-quality music experience to listeners.

> If you're excited for the new iPad Pro 2021, or perhaps one of the tablets we're expecting Apple to debut later in the year like the new iPad or iPad Mini 6, news probably hasn't escaped you of possible stock shortages (or perhaps news had escaped you, so we're sorry you had to find out this way).Word is that when each of the new iPads goes on sale, stock will be pretty limited - we've seen the same thing for PS5s, Xbox Series Xs and RTX 3090 graphics cards, and apparently iPads are next.If you're trying to buy one, then, you might find lots of retailers out of stock, or with units in just a few configurations, and if you try to order one there might be a several-month wait time.

> Bit o' background: While I've always loved computers and dabbled with web dev as a kid, I recently (6ish months?) started coding again hardcore. I had just had a business fail, money was tight as shit, debt to our eyeballs... and I wanted to start again with one of my oldest passions that I'd always been afraid to pursue. So I hunkered down and got into Python, because I remembered liking the language.I pretty quickly got a job in non-Python web dev (Angular and Node.Js, which I was competent enough in thanks to dabbling) but it was awful.

> The first film made such a splash that Aquaman 2 soon became inevitable. That's because the highest-grossing movie ever based on a DC Comics character doesn't belong to any of the famous trinity of Batman, Superman or Wonder Woman. Instead, the Jason Momoa-starring, James Wan-directed Aquaman beat them all – the new king of Atlantis was also crowned DC's king of the box office.It's something of a sea-change for a character who'd traditionally been the butt of the joke in comic-book circles – in everything from Family Guy to the fake James Cameron movie in Entourage.

The Amazon Echo Frames (Gen 2) may sound like another half-hearted attempt by a tech company to shove smart virtual assistants where they don't belong, further complicating and confusing our already crazy lives. But I'm here to tell you that these are actually pretty well thought out, designed, and implemented. After all, they've already been wear-tested for over a year by hundreds of nerds like me.

> Chances are, you or someone in your family has some old slides laying around. Wouldn't it be nice to have them in a digital format that you could share over email or display on your TV screen? We tested two different DIY ways to scan them in. One is a $140 digital scanner while the other is a free app called SlideScan. The app is unique in that all you need to scan your slides is your iPhone or Android. It works really well, but we found that the process is more time consuming and the final results could be hit or miss.

> In the real world – the world on which the global economy runs – we don't expose every aspect of our financial activity in public. We want to be able to select which parties can access our financial data and under what circumstances – for example, our credit history or bank transactions. The problem with the blockchain world is that this financial privacy doesn't really exist. This has led to pretty bad abuses, such as the practice of front-running' where a nefarious person can take advantage of you immediately after seeing your transaction on a public blockchain.

[Google is now rolling out the May update to supported Pixels](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_is_now_rolling_out_the_may_update_to_supported_pixels-news-48945.php)


> It's the first Monday of the month, and you know what that means? A Google update. Of Android. For its Pixel line. Well, those that are still supported anyway. We're talking Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G, and Pixel 5. That's the entire list. All of these devices aside from the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 have build RQ2A.210505.002 headed towards them, while the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 get build RQ2A.210505.003. As usual with Google updates, expect this one to take multiple weeks reaching all of the units out there in the wild, in a very staged rollout.

> At the center of the lawsuit is Fortnite, the hugely popular video game made by Epic that was kicked out of Apple's App Store last summer for flouting its rules on digital payments by establishing its own system. Apple (AAPL) gets a 30% cut of many in-app purchases on iOS devices and does not allow alternative payment systems. Fortnite's removal from the App Store prompted Epic to sue Apple. On day one, Epic and its first witness — the company's CEO, Tim Sweeney — sought to establish that Apple's App Store and its refusal to allow other app stores on its platform constitute anti-competitive behavior.

Skydio is best known as a pioneer of self-flying drone tech, but in recent years has shifted its attention away from a consumer market dominated by Chinese giant DJI to courting enterprise customers instead. This switch is partly due to geopolitics. The US government blacklisted various Chinese drones over spying fears last year, meaning law enforcement, military, and federal customers are looking more to US firms instead.

> OPINION: Is the App Store a monopoly? Something odd happened this week. Apple's stock price dropped nearly 5 per cent following impressive quarterly profits of US$1.40 a share versus the industry's estimate of US$0.98.In this February 5 photo, an Apple store employee wears personal protective equipment in New York. Closer analysis reveals that its revenue was up 66 per cent for iPhones, 70 per cent for Macs, 79 per cent for iPads, 25 per cent for wearables. This, to my simple mind, suggests that its share price should be going up, not down.

Although the stunt was covered by CBS News, BBC News, The Guardian, and others, it did actually make a significant point. By removing the physical piece, the group – calling itself 'Burnt Banksy' – proved that the value of the piece wasn't affected by being destroyed, given that the NFT went up so much in value.

While the anonymity of Craigslist is an appeal for some, being able to see who you are selling to or who you are buying something from is preferred by many people.  Historically, Facebook Marketplace has made it very easy to see who exactly you're buying from or selling to by including their full name and a link to their Facebook profile, but I noticed recently that there's been a change to the site's design.

Because if it's just ‘an Apple Watch', then the Apple Watch SE is an under-rated hit in the making, the better-value smartwatch to get with all the best perks at a great price.However, it doesn't manage to address the flaws that remain in Apple's smartwatch line, despite some notable advantages and a starting price of just $279 / £269 / AU$429. It offers the best of what you'd expect without offering anything new, so you'll be waiting on the fabled Apple Watch SE 2 for any big changes.

> Huawei P40 dealsThe Huawei P40 is a top phone with some fantastic hardware combined to make a stunning experience when it comes to camera, battery life, and a variety of other top-end features you'll want from a modern smartphone.Much like every recent Huawei phone, the P40 is hampered by its software. The Huawei ban in the US has restricted the Chinese company's use of the Google Mobile Services apps, so you're now left with a much more limited experience.That's mostly owing to the lack of Google Play Store functionality, and while the Huawei AppGallery - the company's alternative app store - does offer a number of apps, it's hard for Huawei to compete with the Google behemoth that many developers have flocked to for years.

One YouTuber decided to fix that by dismantling an AirTag and turning it into something much slimmer. Apple's AirTag is now here and it's generally been well received. But there's one problem that we just can't quite get away from – an AirTag is just too bulky to be put into a wallet. That is, it was until one YouTuber decided to fix all that.

As a result, not only do we get a pretty solid phone, whether you're buying it unlocked or with carrier incentives, but we also get a phone that punches above its price point in most categories. Battery life is great, performance is steady most of the time, and even the cameras do pretty decently during the day. The only downside is that the 120Hz screen doesn't get as bright as the competition. $500 at Samsung Larger 120Hz screen Great battery life Four years of security updates IP67 water resistance Tons of carrier incentives No mmWave support Screen washes out Weaker cameras, especially at night The middle child of Google's 2020 lineup is still a great option for 5G on a budget, and with a beefier processor than the A52 5G and support for mmWave on the Verizon model, the Pixel 4a 5G is the more pragmatic pick if you're going to be paying full price.

The Oculus Quest experience went beyond what was expected of a VR headset by being more than just affordable — it was as easy to use as a video game console. Since that launch, Facebook has acquired several VR game development studios, brought several developers onboard with its Oculus Store, and changed the paradigm of what people expect from the standalone VR experience.

However, the same mission that has helped it grow to a business valued at $2.4 billion with over 500 million registered learners, has led to tensions that continue to define the business. How do you survive as a startup if you don't want to charge users? How do you design a startup that isn't too hard to lose people, but isn't too easy to compromise education? How do you balance monetization goals while also keeping education as a product free? For my first EC-1, I spent months with Duolingo executives, investors, and of course, competitors, to answer some of these questions.

That seemed particularly likely when Mr Musk appeared to link his interest in the cryptocurrency to his appearance on the show, tweeting the date of his guest hosting spot and calling himself the 'Dogefather'.But the appearance also came after the Tesla and SpaceX boss urged people to exercise 'caution' when investing in cryptocurrencies.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and rapper Snoop Dogg. Dogecoin is itself an 'altcoin,' as cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin are often referred to, but there are now several imitators that are attempting to ride on the 'tailwind' of the frenzy surrounding the Musk-championed meme crypto.

> An out-of-control Chinese rocket has finally fallen to Earth over the Indian Ocean, according to organisations who had been tracking it.China's Long March 5B rocket was originally launched in late April to carry the first part of China's Tianhe module, which will serve as the core of its planned crewed space station. But the rocket booster itself went into orbit, and began an uncontrolled re-entry that led to fears it could come down above a populated area.It had been difficult to predict where or when the spacecraft might fall back down to Earth because of an array of unknown details, both about the rocket itself but also the way that the atmosphere would act on it.

The US Pentagon had been tracking the rocket body since last week but because of the unusual tumbling of the rocket body and its orbit it had been difficult to predict where -- exactly -- the huge piece of space junk would fall back to the planet.

Second place, though – at least if you ask me – has to go to the injustice of Tenet missing out on a nomination for Best Original Score. Ludwig Göransson (the composer of the toe-tapping theme to The Mandalorian you like so much) created an innovative, thrilling soundtrack that even goes backwards at key moments, to reflect the characters' own journeys through time in the film. Tenet's score is one thing about the Christopher Nolan's Bond-esque sci-fi thriller that I recommend unconditionally.

Jag hittade ett litet program vid namn AutoHDR som gör att det inte behövs. Det är skamligt att Microsoft inte fixat detta själva än. Förhoppningsvis kommer det en fix senare. https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e3e9816a4d0e7ddbb6bc30c6a8a2316349aa3718fad5a94ae37f9222dd1f4e79/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f436f646563746f72792f4175746f4844522f6d61696e2f53637265656e73686f74732f5374617475735f312d362d302e706e67 https://camo.

[Just wanted to share a failed experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/n8egb1/just_wanted_to_share_a_failed_experiment/)


> fileSo I was trying out a new method of data compression where the binary sequence of a file gets converted into a huge decimal number and is then represented as the product of two smaller ones the bit_length sum of which is smaller than that of the original number. The program uses trial and error to find a perfect divider who satisfies this condition so the process can take a while. The idea is that those two resulting numbers can be multiplied anytime to yield the original number and therefore the binary source of the compressed file, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way.

Apple, the maker of the iPhone, and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, wrapped up the first week of testimony on Friday, with the iPhone inventor trying to fend off accusations from the video game developer that its App Store constitutes a monopoly and that it has engaged in anti-competitive behavior.

Host Elon Musk, playing himself, rushes to mission control when NASA's Mars mission goes horribly off the rails. Sacrifice will be necessary to save the crew, and a hero soon emerges in Chad. Musical guest Miley Cyrus also pops up as a fellow astronaut and soon-to-be baby mama to Chad's unborn child. But it's Musk who has the last laugh in the end when he throws back to his recurring IRL faux pas where he insists that "a bunch of people will probably die" once we embark on crewed missions to Mars.

Apple's AirTag was introduced during its April 2021 event. The AirTag is Apple's version of an item tracker that takes advantage of the Find My network to locate missing items.

Still, the V12 Detect Slim is expected to bring everything that's great about the V15 Detect, just in a slightly different and more affordable package.

Yet the phone costs just 200 British pounds, or about $280 at today's currency conversion rate, meaning that 5G is no longer only found on pricey mid- and high-specification phones. But cheap phones can also be substandard, especially when an 'expensive' feature like 5G gets slotted in to grab some headlines. The Realme 8 5G is cheap, but does it feel like it's cheap? MediaTek lends a hand How does Realme offer a phone with 5G for such a low price? One of the reasons is the phone uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor, rather than a Qualcomm chip seen in mid-range smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G and the Google Pixel 4a 5G.

Last year's Mi Band 5 introduced a large OLED screen and a new charging connector, and for 2021 Xiaomi is rolling out a few upgrades with the Mi Band 6.

> Wing Although advances have clearly been made in recent years, there are still a number of obstacles preventing drone delivery services from going mainstream. Top of the list is, of course, safety, with regulators keen for clear proof that any autonomous aircraft flying overhead won't suddenly crash into an obstacle — or indeed each other — putting people on the ground in danger. Another problem that gets less attention is noise. If drone delivery really is to become a part of everyday life for urban communities, the companies developing such aircraft will have to make them much quieter or risk a backlash from those irritated by the buzzing rotors as the machines fly back and forth during delivery runs.

But AirPods' general lack of buttons makes this process feel more complicated than it is. Lucky for you, we know exactly how to accomplish it for the next time your pods won't connect, won't charge correctly, or are generally acting wonky.  Step 1: Put your AirPods in their case. The only button on the whole setup (which, spoiler, we will press) is on the case, so make sure the pods are nestled safely inside before continuing.

> Enlarge / The Apple M1 is a world-class processor—but it feels even faster than its already-great specs imply. Howard Oakley did a deep-dive investigation to find out why. Apple's M1 processor is a world-class desktop and laptop processor—but when it comes to general-purpose end-user systems, there's something even better than being fast. We're referring, of course, to feeling fast—which has more to do with a system meeting user expectations predictably and reliably than it does with raw speed. Howard Oakley—author of several Mac-native utilities such as Cormorant, Spundle, and Stibium—did some digging to find out why his M1 Mac felt faster than Intel Macs did, and he came to the conclusion that the answer is QoS.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 ― The rumours were true, and Apple has now confirmed that Lossless Audio will be coming to its streaming service in June 2021. Along with that, Apple Music will also support Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos — all of which will be offered to subscribers at no additional cost. This, as I previously mentioned, might just be the boost that the Cupertino-based company's music service needs, offering an edge over main rivals Spotify (who have yet to offer the lossless audio format).

[Together, Google and Samsung just may have a chance to beat the Apple Watch](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/google-samsung-together-may-beat-the-apple-watch/)


> At this moment in time, Apple owns the smartwatch space, and the Apple Watch's status as the world's bestselling watch is well-deserved. Google, on the other hand, has let Wear OS stagnate over the years, and while the dedicated companies that use Wear OS keep making great hardware, the software usually feels substandard. Samsung makes the only true competitor to the Apple Watch. The Galaxy Watch 3's fluid, well-designed Tizen software and innovative control system make it a winner, but it lacks Google apps and services.

> Microsoft founder Bill Gates reportedly 'pursued' several women in his office while married to his wife, Melinda French Gates, who is now estranged. Six women told the New York Times that Gates was known for making 'graceless' approaches towards women both inside and outside the office. On at least a few occasions, Bill Gates pursued women who worked for him at both Microsoft, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to a report by the New York Times. Six current and former staffers told the newspaper that the billionaire's questionable conduct created, at times, an uncomfortable workplace environment, and that Gates was known for making graceless approaches toward women, both in and outside of the office.

> The blobs are back in town. Google opened its I/O developer conference Tuesday with a performance that felt genuinely innovative, and actually fun, from the avant-garde vocal and electronica artist Tune-Yards  — and Google's own Blob Opera. The Blob Opera is an interactive Google Arts & Culture project from December 2020 that lets users create their own opera song, sung by animated blobs. Four opera singers spent hours in the studio recording operatic music. Their voices were assigned to four animated characters — called blobs — one each for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, and bass, with the ability to harmonize and sing together due to the machine learning algorithm that powers the project.

If you desire a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2021), last year's case may not be a precise fit due to the 0.5mm thickness increase of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro. You will need to buy a new case if you want it to fit perfectly. The new 3rd-generation 11-inch iPad Pro has the same dimensions as the previous 2020 model; therefore, if you have last year's model and are upgrading, you will not need to purchase a new case.

The wireless keyboard isn't just so your desk is spared one more cable, although it certainly looks the better for it. It's so you can move it around without snagging on something, put it on your lap if you need to, or type on the other side of the room if you fancy it (which might come in useful if you're using your computer screen as a TV and messaging friends at the same time).On the other hand, there are some situations where a cable is necessary: a gaming keyboard, for instance, needs that split-second speed advantage a wired connection offers and some bigger keyboards, especially ergonomic ones, use wires, too.

From the standard Amazon Kindle to the more premium Paperwhite and Oasis models, we expect not just discounts, but also bundles that include additional services like Kindle Unlimited for free. That means you can wrap up some serious value in this year's Prime Day Kindle deals, and looking at last year's offers we're likely to see a return to some record low prices on the devices themselves.

> TL;DR Realme has launched the Watch 2 Pro. It's essentially an upgraded version of the original Realme Watch 2. The smartwatch packs plenty of fitness tracking features, a large display, GPS, and a two-week battery. It's been a little over a month since Realme unveiled the Watch 2, its take on the budget fitness smartwatch. But for those wanting more from their wearable, the company has now unveiled the Realme Watch 2 Pro. Visually, the Watch 2 Pro doesn't differ much from its non-Pro sibling.

> When Privacy.com was founded in 2014, the company's focus was to let anyone generate virtual and disposable payment card numbers for free. The goal was to allow those users to keep users' actual credit card numbers safe while allowing the option to cut off companies from their bank accounts. In an age of near-constant data breaches and credit card skimmers targeting unsuspecting websites, Privacy.com has made it harder for hackers to get anyone's real credit card details. The concept has appealed to many.

[HP launches the new Omen 25i gaming monitor, starting at just $349](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/hp-omen-25i-gaming-monitor-starts-at-349/)


> Gaming monitors typically start at 27-inches, which is what makes the HP Omen 25i quite unique. The smaller 25-inch screen means a smaller overall footprint, which could make the Omen 25i a good option for college students or anyone with a compact desk. That also means this isn't an overly expensive monitor. The new Omen 25i costs $349. That's $70 more than the previous Omen 25, but it's still not overly expensive for a gaming monitor. That's especially true, considering the high-end design of this screen.

> Apple is blurring the line between the iPad and the Mac. With the company's messaging around higher-end iPad models referring to them as laptop replacements and the new iPad actually including the same chip as new Macs, there's no denying that it's harder than ever to decide which one to go for. Despite the similar processing power, Macs are still generally more capable than iPads, thanks largely to the desktop-class operating system — MacOS. But they're not better for everything. In fact, there are plenty of things that the iPad Pro is better at than the Mac.

While the outfit is backed by all the usual suspects, including endowments and pension funds, it's worth noting that around $130 million of that capital comes from investors and other employees inside of Bain, whose contributions typically make up 10% of a fund.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority said on Friday it found that in mid-2020, Telstra breached identity verification rules on at least 52 occasions, Medion Mobile on 53 occasions, and Optus on one occasion. ACMA Chair Nerida O'Loughlin said that under new rules introduced in early 2020, telcos must have more rigorous customer verification processes in place, such as multifactor or in-person identification.

I forked that old project since it hasn't been active since around 2016, and I reverse-engineered the decompiling for a lot of the new commands on the TI-84+ CE.

> A bipartisan group of lawmakers are introducing a bill Friday that would give states more control over which court hears antitrust lawsuits brought against companies, according to a copy of the proposal obtained by Axios.Why it matters: This bill would ensure that state AGs — which are suing companies more and more — get home-court advantage by choosing the court to hear the case and ensuring the case stays there.Between the lines: While the legislation may appear to be a narrow procedural change, it would give a big boost to the chances states' top enforcement arms have of winning antitrust lawsuits.

> (Image credit: Apple) The 7th-gen iPod touch we saw appear in 2019 was something of a surprise – before that, Apple hadn't refreshed its dedicated music player since 2015 – but apparently the pocketable jukebox isn't dead yet, with another model rumored to be on the way this year.That's according to MacRumors contributor @SteveMoser and tipster @AppleLe257 on Twitter, although they're keen to label this as a 'rumor' rather than a 'leak' – so it sounds like it's something that's been heard in passing from inside sources, rather than something there is hard evidence for.

> Startups used to be obsessed with billboards. It was the first thing I noticed when I moved to San Francisco: venture-backed companies including Eaze, Airbnb, and notoriously, Brex, would post large billboard advertisements all over the city to grab attention and eyeballs. When I dug into it more, I learned this type of old school, outdoor advertising was a response to the increasingly crowded online channels, such as Facebook and Instagram advertisements. Well, folks, years later, we have a new response to crowded marketing channels: Ditch the billboards and just buy a media company instead.

Lots of people invest in the latest gaming console or a great computer, keyboard and mouse, but they neglect one important factor: internet speed. If you're plagued by persistent lag while carrying out critical split-second decisions that make the difference between victory and defeat, a sluggish internet connection could be to blame.

Not to mention that some popular sound bars don't come with subwoofers. Creative tries to address all these points with the Carrier, and does it in a way that feels like it just works out of the box.

> The Sonos One is the best smart speaker you can buy. Despite being released a couple of years ago, it's a contender that's tough to overlook even with all the competition from big players such as Google, Amazon, and Apple. It's not often you find something that supports both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. Call it rare, which it is, but it also features fantastic sound for its size, support for Apple's AirPlay 2 wireless streaming, and — because it's a Sonos — it's a champ at multi-room audio, integrating with the rest of your Sonos setup right out the box.

> THE crypto market is in trouble again as China cracked down on coin mining and Bitcoin sat at just 50% of it all-time high on Sunday. However, a small rebound this morning saw Bitcoin's value rise from $32,000 to $36,000. The Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin currencies are also suffering though all three remain significantly up on where they were at the start of 2021. The market turmoil comes after China launched a cryptocurrency crackdown, which has led to top mining companies shutting down. Mining for cryptocurrency isn't actually a physical enterprise, rather it involves extremely sophisticated computers figuring out complicated maths problems in order to process crypto transactions.

While the program is a way to help lower costs while also promoting vaccinations in general, there are some points to be aware of before booking a ride, including how much riders can save and how to go about booking a free COVID-19 ride. Due to the various lockdown and stay-at-home orders that were issued, ride-sharing was one of the areas initially hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, services like Uber and Lyft were quick to make changes to ensure they continued serving local communities during the turbulent period, including delivering groceries, medicines, and other essentials.

We've seen a rumored Mac mini refresh that's about half the thickness of the Intel machines that still sell in the Apple Store. We even have an M1 in an iPad. So how thin – or how small – could Apple go? It's abundantly clear that much of Apple's design in recent years hasn't been about fitting components into a box.

This morning is no exception. Doximity filed to go public earlier today. You likely haven't heard of the company because it exists in the modestly obscure world of telehealth. But it's a venture-backed startup all the same that raised more than $80 million from investors like Emergence, InterWest Partners, Morgenthaler Ventures and Threshold, according to Crunchbase data.

[Is it worth the extra cost to buy Samsung's Galaxy Watch 3 with LTE?](https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-samsung-galaxy-watch-lte)


> Source: SamsungBest answer: Most people should buy the standard Bluetooth model of the Galaxy Watch 3. It's less expensive upfront and doesn't require an ongoing service with your carrier. Aside from streaming music and receiving calls independent of your phone, it does everything that the LTE model does — and has better battery life. The Galaxy Watch 3 is not a cheap device, starting at $339 for the 41mm Bluetooth model, but is the Galaxy Watch 3 with LTE worth it? The LTE models get an obvious price mark-up — that's whether you buy directly from Samsung or buy from a carrier like T-Mobile.

[Russian Authorities Tell Airlines To Expect Delays Due To Belarusian Airspace Ban](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/belarus/2021/belarus-210528-rferl03.htm)


> By RFE/RL May 28, 2021 Russia's state air transport agency says changes to routes from Europe to Russia as a result of the dispute between the West and Belarus over the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to Minsk may result in longer clearance times. Rosaviatsiya said in a statement on May 28 that it had informed airlines to expect delays after Russia denied access to two European carriers that amended flight plans to skirt Belarus en route to Moscow. EU leaders have asked European carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace after the incident on May 23.

[Technology, health care firms propel stocks higher](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/may/29/technology-health-care-firms-propel-stocks-higher/)


> Stocks capped a listless day of trading on Wall Street with modest gains Friday and the S&P 500's first weekly gain in three weeks. Gains in technology and health care companies outweighed a slide in communications stocks, retailers and elsewhere in the market. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% and notched a 1.2% gain for the week. The benchmark index closed out the final day of trading in May with a monthly gain of 0.5%. That's the index's fourth straight monthly increase and follows a bumpy few weeks in the markets as investors moved past a stellar corporate earnings season and focused on the tug-of-war between the economic recovery and rising inflation.

This year it's Man City vs. Chelsea in an all-English clash for all the marbles.  Who's the favourite? Based on current form, it's hard to pick against Man City. In their last outing they ripped Everton to shreds in a 5-0 drubbing. But anything can happen in football and, since sacking Lampard and bringing in Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea have looked and played like a different team -- a much better team.

[HOWTO: Configure a Python script to run on boot in Windows and macOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/nnt6jn/howto_configure_a_python_script_to_run_on_boot_in/)


> I'm working on a project that requires distributed data processing (no, not cryptomining... compiling public data from the federal government into some relational databases for personal use).As part of this task, I have a few dedicated machines on which I'd like to run a Python agent-type script as a background process. Notably, I want to run it on system boot, not within the context of a specific login. Some of these tasks run for multiple days (e.g., the main database is over a terabyte), and I don't want my actions of logging into or out of the machine to terminate the process and interrupt or ruin a bunch of work.

> A man rescued an iPhone 12 Pro from a canal in Berlin, but instead of diving in, he took advantage of MagSafe and fished for the smartphone. On Saturday, a friend of app developer Frederik Riedel dropped his iPhone 12 Pro into a canal in Berlin. At the time, it was thought the device was lost, as it sank into the mud at the bottom of the water. An initial attempt to rescue the iPhone where its owner waded through the 3-foot-deep mud failed, with seeming "no way to find it." As told on Twitter, Riedel and the friend instead went down the route of magnet fishing.

> So for those who don't play guitar or know anything about music in general here's a quick rundown:There are 12 notes in music and they go from A to G#, but they could really start anywhere as they will just repeat. Google musical notes for more info. As such there are 12 frets on a guitar to cover all 12 notes, and usually a guitar will go to 22 or 24 or even 29 frets. When you start at one note and go through all other 11 notes you will hit the same note but at a higher pitch, called an octave. So frets 1 & 13 on the same string are the same note but different octaves.

In the case of an AI-assisted disease detection, these shortcuts could lead to diagnostic errors if deployed in clinical settings, warn researchers.A team from the University of Washington in the US, examined multiple models recently put forward as potential tools for accurately detecting Covid-19 from chest radiography, otherwise known as chest X-rays.The findings, published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence, showed that rather than learning genuine medical pathology, these models rely instead on shortcut learning to draw spurious associations between medically irrelevant factors and disease status.

The arm performs station maintenance, moves supplies – and even astronauts – and performs 'cosmic catches' by grappling visiting crafts and bringing them to the ISS.The inspection, which took place on 12 May, found that the puncture came from a piece of space debris that was too small to be tracked – which accounts for rock or dust particles to flecks of paint from satellites, the CSA says.

Thanks to a limited-time offer at Costco Canada, the Moto G Fast is dropping even lower in price! Through June 6, customers can purchase the Moto G Fast on sale for just $159.

> Todd Lowenstein is the equity strategist with The Private Bank at Union Bank. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Life may be returning to normal for most people. But not for die-hard tech stock fans.Their stocks are among the least liked by other investors, according to a recent Bank of America fund manager survey. It found that fund managers have the lowest level allocation toward tech since 2003. How can this be? Tech has a growth issue. That seems odd, but it makes sense if you think it through.

> Over the past two weeks, we've been Naruto-running headfirst into an extraterrestrial epidemic. A highly anticipated unclassified report, expected to be delivered to the US Congress this month, has sparked renewed interest in UFOs, alien visitation and government cover-ups. The report, written by a crack team of experts from the Pentagon, the FBI and the Office of Naval Intelligence, is expected to feature evidence of "unidentified aerial phenomena," or UAP. So, aliens are back in vogue. Their popularity is approaching levels not seen since the "Storm Area 51" raid of 2019, when a viral Facebook event became a meme and turned the town of Rachel, Nevada, upside down.
