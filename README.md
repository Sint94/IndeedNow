Nevertheless, that's not to say we haven't seen some cash skimmed off the controller's price, though this latest round of PS5 deals is offering a particularly stunning discount. You'll find the £59.99 PS5 DualSense controller available for just £50.39 at ShopTo's official eBay storefront.

> Mar 10, 2004 14,029 517 Bergen, Norway I'm in the process of replacing my TV set up, and get a 4K TV. Currently I have a 42" Toshiba 1080 TV, Apple TV 4 HD and Denon CEOL Piccolo, and I'm planning to replace all of them. Now, technology has definitively moved forward since I got any of the stuff above (and especially since I got the TV i 2009), so I'm a bit uncertain what my best options are. To get the sound from the Apple TV out, I'm currently using Airplay to the Piccolo, which works OK (lip sync is fine, but there's a picture and sound delay, which is annoying when pausing/restarting), so I want to have wired set up from now on.

The Mi QLED TV 4K 55 (yes, it is quite the mouthful) is no exception. The 55 does indicate the size of the screen and there is no variant in this, just a single model. The Mi QLED TV is quite attractive looking. It has a metallic bezel-less design which screams premium. While it does not ship with a wall-mount, it does come with metallic legs which form a very steady stand.

[Mac Mini M1](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-mini-m1-need-stereo-line-input-options.2279437/)


> On my Windows PC, there is a line-in that I was using to plug in a standard 3.5mm headphone jack so I could listen to a secondary input source at the same time as normal Windows audio. I just got an M1 mini to use daily (Windows PC will be only for PC gaming now) and tried plugging in the same 3.5mm headphone jack connector as an input from my external source, but Mac OS doesn't recognize it. Headphone output from the jack is fine, but no input. Unfortunately I learned that this jack isn't a true line input so I can't use it how I originally thought.

> Hi, I have a Dell P2715Q, and I'm having trouble getting it to work smoothly on any other resolution than its highest - 3840x2160. It's currently connected to my Mac mini 2018 with a DisplayPort to USB-C cord. I've tried to use another DisplayPort to USB-C cord, and an multiple HDMI cords, but I think I can rule out a connection issue. For the record, using an HDMI connection has resulted in curser delay. From the preferences pane, I've tried other resolutions (default for display, and scaled), but 3840x2160 seems to be the only resolution that works well.

> (Image credit: Future) Those looking for the perfect combination of power and portability may have struck gold with the latest Surface Pro deals. We regularly see these tablets discounted, and on special occasions with the Type Cover keyboard included as well, but you'll find both the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Pro X on sale right now for some of their lowest prices yet.  The cheapest model on offer, the i5 Surface Pro 7 with 8GB RAM and a 128GB SSD comes in at just $789.90 right now . That's a fantastic price considering the cheapest we've ever seen it was over Black Friday - and even then it was at $799.

[Bitcoin boom threatens to turn it into pure gold](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/09/bitcoin-boom-threatens-to-turn-it-into-pure-gold)


> Bitcoin is back, along with the debate over its value. The price of the digital currency is soaring and last week it hit more than $40,000 for the first time, having doubled in less than a month. Its price has jumped by more than 700% since the pandemic was first declared in March last year, rising from about $5,000. But breathless headlines are nothing new for the 12-year-old cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has been here before, in the previous decade, when it went on a tear with a predictable outcome. Drawing parallels with the tulip mania of the 17th century, bitcoin soared from just below $1,000 at the start of 2017 to come close to $20,000 within 12 months, then crashed to about $3,000 within a few weeks in early 2018.

I couldn't find anything that does not require spotify api and embeds stuff in a way that could be used for downloading large playlists and in scripts for example ytmdl was choosing wrong metadata and filenames weren't unique. It uses youtube-dl and ffmpeg. It currently works on linux and macs (i think), but modifying it to work under windows should be easy.

So far, we've shown how we came up with a fairly simple Class and Instance model for thinking about runtime Rust classes. In Part 1, we used these for type checking, and in Part 2 we added support for reading attributes off of a struct. In this post, we pick up where we left off with attribute getters, and expand into method calls. In some ways, the same techniques we used for attributes work just as well here.

Though deprived of his big online megaphones, Trump does have alternative options of much smaller reach, led by the far right-friendly Parler — even if Google removed it from its app store Friday and Apple threatened the same. Trump may launch his own platform. But that won't happen overnight, and free speech experts anticipate growing pressure on all social media platforms to curb incendiary speech as Americans take stock of Wednesday's violent takeover of the U.

"Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 - Safety - Objectionable Content."Apple's notice said Parler's responses to an earlier warning were inadequate, including Parler's defense that it had been taking violent rhetoric on its platform "very seriously for weeks" and that it had a moderation plan "for the time being," according to Apple.

> One Twitter wag joked about lights flickering on and off at the White House being Donald Trump signalling to his followers in Morse code after Twitter and Facebook squelched the president for inciting rebellion. Though deprived of his big online megaphones, Trump does have alternative options of much smaller reach. The far right-friendly Parler may be the leading candidate, though Google and Apple have both removed it from their app stores and Amazon decided to boot it off its web hosting service.

The company also bans Hezbollah from its platform because of its status as a US-designated foreign terror organization, despite the fact that the party holds seats in Lebanon's parliament. And it bans leaders in countries under US sanctions. At the same time, both Facebook and Twitter have stuck to the tenet that content posted by elected officials deserves more protection than material from ordinary individuals, thus giving politicians' speech more power than that of the people .

> I have been wondering about this for a few days. After reading an article on Medium about "What 60,000 views of my article earned" The author of the article got $1000 for these views. So I was wondering could you use selenium webDriver to automate an incognito chrome browser to open and then navigate to the page, 100 times a day for 60 days? Would each of these be unique according to medium? I know that running the driver is possible, but what I am asking is would medium think they are unique?

The 4,500-mAh battery keeps it running for a full day, and the four-camera system does well in a variety of lighting conditions, though it's still not as good as the Pixel 3A. It feels more premium because it's a glass sandwich, but that also makes it fragile.The plastic-backed 10L is more durable and has similarly good performance, even if it uses the slower Snapdragon 665 processor—for $200 less.

On January 9, 2007, Jobs introduced the world to a new kind of phone, a phone that would do to smartphones what the Macintosh had done to personal computers in 1984 – literally change how we used them, even while making them far easier to use. Of course, like the Macintosh in 1984, the iPhone was not a perfect device. It had its share of flaws. But just as the Macintosh in 1984, the iPhone rose above its shortcomings thanks to its inherent strengths.

> Jan 10, 2021 1 0 Mount Dora, FL Last night while copying files from a USB drive to the HD, all drives on the SATA backplane ports spontaneously disappeared. I tried all the slots, reset NVRAM, SMC with no success. Both of the SATA ports in the optical bays are working fine if I move the HDs up there. Right now running 10.13.6 from a 128 GB crucial SSD and a 1TB spinning drive on the second one. Since this was supposed to be a media server, not having the CD drive or the extra HD slots makes it a deal-breaker.
