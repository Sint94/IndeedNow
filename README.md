[DualSense controller hits lowest price ever in latest PS5 deals](https://www.techradar.com/news/dualsense-controller-hits-lowest-price-ever-in-latest-ps5-deals)


> (Image credit: Future) PS5 controller deals have been rare over the last few months. The console only hit the shelves in November, and the controllers represented one of the biggest upgrades to the next-generation system. Nevertheless, that's not to say we haven't seen some cash skimmed off the controller's price, though this latest round of PS5 deals is offering a particularly stunning discount. You'll find the £59.99 PS5 DualSense controller available for just £50.39 at ShopTo's official eBay storefront.
