Details are sketchy at the moment, but the new Apple Music HiFi will reportedly cost $9.99 per user, the same as its individual plans. Essentially, Apple Music HiFi will provide a high-quality music experience to listeners.

> If you're excited for the new iPad Pro 2021, or perhaps one of the tablets we're expecting Apple to debut later in the year like the new iPad or iPad Mini 6, news probably hasn't escaped you of possible stock shortages (or perhaps news had escaped you, so we're sorry you had to find out this way).Word is that when each of the new iPads goes on sale, stock will be pretty limited - we've seen the same thing for PS5s, Xbox Series Xs and RTX 3090 graphics cards, and apparently iPads are next.If you're trying to buy one, then, you might find lots of retailers out of stock, or with units in just a few configurations, and if you try to order one there might be a several-month wait time.

> Bit o' background: While I've always loved computers and dabbled with web dev as a kid, I recently (6ish months?) started coding again hardcore. I had just had a business fail, money was tight as shit, debt to our eyeballs... and I wanted to start again with one of my oldest passions that I'd always been afraid to pursue. So I hunkered down and got into Python, because I remembered liking the language.I pretty quickly got a job in non-Python web dev (Angular and Node.Js, which I was competent enough in thanks to dabbling) but it was awful.

> The first film made such a splash that Aquaman 2 soon became inevitable. That's because the highest-grossing movie ever based on a DC Comics character doesn't belong to any of the famous trinity of Batman, Superman or Wonder Woman. Instead, the Jason Momoa-starring, James Wan-directed Aquaman beat them all – the new king of Atlantis was also crowned DC's king of the box office.It's something of a sea-change for a character who'd traditionally been the butt of the joke in comic-book circles – in everything from Family Guy to the fake James Cameron movie in Entourage.

[Review: The Amazon Echo Frames (2nd Gen) are more than a concept product](https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-frames-2nd-gen-review)


> Source: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central Before you roll your eyes at another smart glasses review, just hear me out. The Amazon Echo Frames (Gen 2) may sound like another half-hearted attempt by a tech company to shove smart virtual assistants where they don't belong, further complicating and confusing our already crazy lives. But I'm here to tell you that these are actually pretty well thought out, designed, and implemented. After all, they've already been wear-tested for over a year by hundreds of nerds like me.

> Chances are, you or someone in your family has some old slides laying around. Wouldn't it be nice to have them in a digital format that you could share over email or display on your TV screen? We tested two different DIY ways to scan them in. One is a $140 digital scanner while the other is a free app called SlideScan. The app is unique in that all you need to scan your slides is your iPhone or Android. It works really well, but we found that the process is more time consuming and the final results could be hit or miss.

> In the real world – the world on which the global economy runs – we don't expose every aspect of our financial activity in public. We want to be able to select which parties can access our financial data and under what circumstances – for example, our credit history or bank transactions. The problem with the blockchain world is that this financial privacy doesn't really exist. This has led to pretty bad abuses, such as the practice of front-running' where a nefarious person can take advantage of you immediately after seeing your transaction on a public blockchain.

[Google is now rolling out the May update to supported Pixels](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_is_now_rolling_out_the_may_update_to_supported_pixels-news-48945.php)


> It's the first Monday of the month, and you know what that means? A Google update. Of Android. For its Pixel line. Well, those that are still supported anyway. We're talking Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G, and Pixel 5. That's the entire list. All of these devices aside from the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 have build RQ2A.210505.002 headed towards them, while the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 get build RQ2A.210505.003. As usual with Google updates, expect this one to take multiple weeks reaching all of the units out there in the wild, in a very staged rollout.

> At the center of the lawsuit is Fortnite, the hugely popular video game made by Epic that was kicked out of Apple's App Store last summer for flouting its rules on digital payments by establishing its own system. Apple (AAPL) gets a 30% cut of many in-app purchases on iOS devices and does not allow alternative payment systems. Fortnite's removal from the App Store prompted Epic to sue Apple. On day one, Epic and its first witness — the company's CEO, Tim Sweeney — sought to establish that Apple's App Store and its refusal to allow other app stores on its platform constitute anti-competitive behavior.

Skydio is best known as a pioneer of self-flying drone tech, but in recent years has shifted its attention away from a consumer market dominated by Chinese giant DJI to courting enterprise customers instead. This switch is partly due to geopolitics. The US government blacklisted various Chinese drones over spying fears last year, meaning law enforcement, military, and federal customers are looking more to US firms instead.

We've been warned of potential storage shortages and price hikes as a result of Chia, which uses a proof of space and time model that allows miners to farm/earn the currency by allocating their unused disk space. Adata says it has prompted a 500% increase in its SSD sales, while Galax says that mining Chia will void its SSDs' warranties.

> OPINION: Is the App Store a monopoly? Something odd happened this week. Apple's stock price dropped nearly 5 per cent following impressive quarterly profits of US$1.40 a share versus the industry's estimate of US$0.98.In this February 5 photo, an Apple store employee wears personal protective equipment in New York. Closer analysis reveals that its revenue was up 66 per cent for iPhones, 70 per cent for Macs, 79 per cent for iPads, 25 per cent for wearables. This, to my simple mind, suggests that its share price should be going up, not down.

Although the stunt was covered by CBS News, BBC News, The Guardian, and others, it did actually make a significant point. By removing the physical piece, the group – calling itself 'Burnt Banksy' – proved that the value of the piece wasn't affected by being destroyed, given that the NFT went up so much in value.
