Of course, this time the Steelers won't be resting their first-string starters like QB Ben Roethlisberger and will be pushing themselves to the limit this time. Also coming off a restful weekend for the Steelers will be J.J. Watt and Cam Howard. Even without several impactful starters, Pittsburgh still nearly beat the Browns. It's optimistic to assume Cleveland will be moving on past week 18.

"Now, that means that if you have an underlying health condition that increases your risk of Covid and you're 25, it has to be approaching an increased risk of 100 fold to overcome the protective effects of age," said Mr Brown According to the scientist, people with rare illnesses who are particularly at risk can access an early vaccine under exceptional circumstances.

[Review: OnePlus Band is just not worth your time (or money)](https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-band-review)

OnePlus followed the Q1 with the U1 and budget-focused Y1 series, and it has carved out a niche for itself in India in this category.

Sony first announced the Airpeak drone project in November 2020, but didn't reveal any images or details about the kind of flying machine it had in store. Well, we've now seen some short videos of Airpeak in action at CES 2021 – and it's fair to say it's aimed at the high-end professional market. What we're looking at is a pro rival to the likes of the DJI Inspire 2, rather than affordable consumer drones like the DJI Mavic Air 2.

> Alfred Gescheidt/Getty Images Facebook, Microsoft and Google have joined a growing list of big banks and other major companies pausing their political spending following last week's violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. One after another, corporate responses have escalated. Some have suspended donations to lawmakers who objected to the certification of the election. Many have halted all of their political donations for a few months. A few went as far as to support the removal of the president. "The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy," said National Association of Manufacturers CEO Jay Timmons, urging Vice President Mike Pence to consider invoking the 25th Amendment that allows removal of a president deemed unfit to serve.

That includes posts you previously deleted on Parler. Over the past few days, archivists have been pulling content from Parler in order to store them for legal and historical purposes. Archivists began to save the data because they were concerned that users would remove their posts, deleting possible evidence of crime at the Capitol. However, once companies like Amazon announced they were ending their business relationships with Parler, it became a race to archive the content before the platform went offline.

As per a report by Counterpoint Research, the new iPhone's 5G components and the A14 Bionic chipset contributes to the increased costs, taking the Bill of Materials (BoM) to $431. 'Assuming a 38% mmWave mix, the blended materials cost for the iPhone 12 with 128GB NAND flash is nearly $415, a 21% increase over its predecessor.

[Review: Logitech's colorful G733 headset stands out with style](https://www.androidcentral.com/logitech-g733-review)


> I've tested a bunch of wireless and wired headsets over the past few weeks, and the latest on my ears is the Logitech G733. While I can't say it's my favorite of the bunch, it's certainly a damn good headset in its own right. It can't compete with its Astro cousins like the A40, but it isn't trying to. This is more of a mid-tier headset for someone who doesn't want to spend too much money but still wants a wireless experience. What's better is that it supports DTS:X 2.0 virtual surround sound. Though you lose that on PS5, you're still getting good audio quality, just nothing spectacular.

> Electronic learning doesn't necessarily require a keyboard and mouse. Apple's iPad wasn't the first tablet computer, but when it arrived in spring 2010, it changed everything. Now, with millions of apps on Apple and Android devices, the tablet is king, every bit as much as the laptop. In many ways it's even better, especially as far as children are concerned. The tablet is unbeatably portable – thin, lightweight and not much bigger than the size of the display. The touchscreen interface is hugely intuitive and since a virtual keyboard can appear on the display, you don't really need anything else.

You can direct list, and merely start to trade. You can host a hybrid auction-offering, like what Unity did. Hell, Google showed us back in the day that a reverse-Dutch auction is possible, after which no one else deigned to try it. And then there's the blank-check method: Instead of taking your company private, some rich people list a pile of hungry money instead, and then go hunting for a private company to merge with.

The real kicker is that this is the processor that will likely power the Galaxy S21 in India unless Samsung flips a switch or something and decides to launch it with Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 888–that is the version expected to be sold internationally including in the US.

Conversations that last weeks or even days get lost and context gets fuzzy. Threads scroll up into the past and are never seen again. Despite the 'asychronous' claim, you have to keep a steady eye on it and reply in realtime or the conversation will move on without you. Anyone who takes the time to ponder and respond thoughtfully with context and explanation will find that they're too late.

> Big Tech has become the subject of increasing scrutiny by governments across the world in recent years, perhaps none more so than Google, which thanks to its dominance of the search business and its control of Android, the most popular mobile operating system, exerts a stupendous degree of control over the products and information we consume. That influence has often resulted in the company fielding allegations of anti-competitive practices, with the latest of these being a lawsuit by YouTube rival Rumble, which claims that Google is "unfairly rigging its search algorithms" to favor YouTube, which Google owns, over its competitors (via The Wall Street Journal).

> At CES 2021, Nvidia launched a wide range of graphics cards, both for laptops and even a new Ampere desktop graphics card: the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060. One of the big things I noticed, however, is that a couple of the SKUs now have an inflated VRAM spec, and it kind of makes the entire Nvidia RTX 3000 lineup a bit confusing. At the top-end of the new mobile stack you have the RTX 3080 with 16GB, but the RTX 3080 for desktop has 10GB. Similarly, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 has 12GB of VRAM, while the RTX 3060 Ti – a graphics card that should be more powerful and is 20% more expensive – has less VRAM at 8GB.

[Samsung Galaxy S21 launch: what to expect from S21 Ultra to SmartTags](https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-launch-five-things-we-expect-to-see)


> We're expecting several devices and a few surprises when the Samsung Galaxy S21 phones launch on January 14. We've heard plenty of rumors about the phones, so we have a good idea of what we could see from them – but there's always the chance that Samsung completely surprises us with new products.Samsung is announcing its phones over a month earlier than we expected. The company often announces its handsets in February or March around the time of Mobile World Congress. While the company hasn't explicitly explained why it's moved up its timetable, we can guess that the online-only nature of these events motivated Samsung to just introduce its first big devices of the year without waiting for whatever MWC 2021 brings.

> The Astro A50 is a well-known high-end headset, so I was excited to try it out for the first time with the PS5. It's comfortable, even after very extended sessions playing some of the best PS5 games such as Demon's Souls. Unfortunately, there are some shortcomings PS5 owners need to be aware of, which are only exacerbated by this headset's hefty price tag. The pricetag is consistent if you want to use it on your PC since functionality, fortunately, isn't limited there.

> In 2020, we all learned the hard way just how bad our laptop webcams all are. They're a horrible, grainy mess, and they make for a terrible videoconferencing experience. That's why I was certain that coming to CES 2021 , the virtual show-floor would be flooded with laptops with 1080p webcams. Surely, after over eight months of constant blurry Zoom calls, companies like Lenovo, HP, Dell, and Asus would relieve our pain. But I was wrong. Very, very wrong. Only one company, MSI, had the smarts to bring a proper 1080p webcam to its laptops — and it's not the one you would have thought.

The chunky, 17-inch gaming laptop now has the updated chassis to match the 15-inch model, the GE66 Raider. But both laptops have the updated webcam, connectivity, and graphics. Rather than moving to AMD, the GE76 Raider sticks with the older 10th-gen Intel H processors.

Although I would greatly appreciate the integration with my Macbook, I will miss a few Android specific features from my current Google Pixel - specifically, "silence unknown callers" and "call screening." Additionally, Android allows for a number of robust third-party (largely unapproved) ad blocking services. Are there iOS alternatives to these things or will Apple's walled garden largely prohibit such solutions? 2. From what I can discern, my Macbook already allows me to send iMessages without being tied to a phone number - how would directly tying the Messages client to an iPhone improve the experience? 3.

> One of the best phones of 2019, the Xiaomi Mi Note 10, didn't see a successor last year, which had us thinking the Xiaomi Mi Note 11 might never arrive. But it seems we might still see the phone. Twitter user @_the_tech_guy, who has a record of unearthing useful information, found references to both the Mi Note 11 and the Xiaomi Mi Mix 4 in code for MIUI, Xiaomi's user interface which sits on top of Android. MIUI code often contains references to future Xiaomi phones - the Mi Note 10's 108MP camera was leaked that way - and it seems likely such code would only be added leading up to a phone's launch.

That's all on top of a bolder sound and better water and sweat resistance for workouts. $200 at Samsung Bolder sound Solid ANC performance Dynamic ambient mode 360 audio ability Significant water resistance Smaller charging case Fit requires more fidgeting Proprietary ear tips Lower battery life Samsung righted some important wrongs when they made these earbuds as successors to the originals, and the benefits are a major leap in battery life, plus improved audio fidelity.

What Happened:  Electrek  reports Tuesday that Wettbewerbszentrale has judged the software names as being misleading. Tesla stock did not seem to respond negatively to the news and was trading 0.86% higher at $1,510 at the time of publication.  The decision prevents Tesla from including "full potential for autonomous driving" and "autopilot inclusive" in German advertising, according to Reuters .

> Need? No. Does it help? Sure.And let's talk a little bit about why and how. The first, and most obvious, is credentialism: people will respect your background more if you have a degree. It's bullshit, it's unfair, and it's increasingly inaccurate as collegiate programs focus more and more on being job-training programs (bad job-training programs).Second, however, is just that mastering a skill is hard. No matter how much an auto-didact you are, there are a lot more ways to program wrong than there are to programming "correctly", and navigating that thicket of failure is a lot easier if you have good instructors and a firm theoretical footing.

It said there had been "confusion" about its message. Since the announcement and notifications went out across its platform, millions of people around the world have downloaded alternative encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram.

Taking reviews or review rating systems at face value is what most consumers do because it's a quick way to make a decision, but that's what those that create fake reviews are counting on. There are companies in countries outside the U.S. selling large numbers of fake reviews, so it's always a good idea to watch for grammar and language errors, or suspicious usernames.

In the same thread, he took time to call out a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called 'bluesky,' which is aiming to build up an 'open decentralized standard for social media' that Twitter is just one part of. Researchers involved with bluesky reveal to TechCrunch an initiative still in its earliest stages that could fundamentally shift the power dynamics of the social web.

This works with Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, but because it is larger than the S Pen, storing it within the new case won't be possible.The pricing and availability details of the S Pen Pro haven't been announced and it is expected to be made available later this year.

> Scientists have located a ‘Super Earth' that is being believed to orbit one of the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The exoplanet gets its title as it is suspected to be around three times the mass of Earth, with a size 50% larger than our home planet.The planet, known as TOI-561b, has been described in a new study accepted for publication in the The Astronomical Journal. Despite the planet's mass, its density is about the same as that of Earth, astronomers found in the study.'We report the discovery of TOI-561, a multi-planet system in the galactic thick disk that contains a rocky, ultra-short period planet (USP),' the study mentions.

Yes, we had the 'Space Zoom' gimmick at last year's S20 Ultra launch. But this time we're talking about genuinely useful optical zoom . Like the Huawei Mate 40 Pro Plus , the S21 Ultra combines two dedicated telephoto cameras – one offering 3x zoom, the other 10x zoom.

The amount a user should invest in setting up even the most basic home studio depends on what the user is looking to focus on. Cover singers, rappers, and podcasters usually look to record good quality audio and may not be involved in other aspects of music production. USB microphones are a great choice for beginners who want to focus solely on recording vocals. XLR microphones need an audio interface to work and cannot be connected directly to a computer but they allow multiple mics to be connected at once and are ideal for live shows, elaborate podcasting sessions, and music production.

Even the server that hosts it, such as Signal or iMessage on Apple devices, can't decrypt and read what someone wrote. If those servers were ever hacked, hackers wouldn't be able to read the messages, either.

[2021 is the year of the Chromebook: here's why](https://www.techradar.com/news/is-2021-the-year-of-the-chrombook)


> For several years now, Chromebooks have slowly gained a pretty dedicated following as former skeptics became converts - and even prosthelytizers - of the lightweight Chrome OS and the highly affordable laptops it powers. Still, it hasn't come close to challenging Microsoft or Apple - or even Linux - as the operating system of choice for the vast majority of consumers.There are a whole host of reasons for this, not the least of which is Microsoft's far-sighted strategy of licensing its operating systems to OEMs, which helped it capture over 95% of the PC market in the early to mid 1990s, a market position that has only slightly eroded due to the popularity of Apple's competing OSX-powered laptops and desktops.

> Some in the Biden administration are likely to advocate for municipal broadband networks. Always controversial, building these networks may be a particularly poor choice for most localities in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if federal subsidy dollars become available, municipal broadband networks require significant ongoing capital investment to operate, often funded by issuing new debt. Cities have seen their tax revenues shrink with pandemic shutdowns, and taking on additional debt to support broadband networks will be difficult to justify.

Instead of focusing on epic superheroics, the new Disney Plus TV show turns Avengers Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) and Vision into a married couple at the center of their very own sitcom.While the first two episodes are set in the 1950s and 1960s, however – and feature many of the sitcom tropes of their respective eras – that doesn't mean WandaVision sits between the 1940s-set Agent Carter and the 1970-set sequence in Avengers: Endgame in the MCU timeline.

In April of 2017, Microsoft Edge features, and functionality improvements highlighted the Windows 10 Creators Update , but not everyone was happy with Edge's advancements. For example, Microsoft pundit Paul Thurrott called out some of the browser's most crucial failings, and these limitations were definitely glaring. One of his complaints was the lack of a full-screen view , and that unlike Chrome, hitting the F11 key did nothing in Edge.

[Attacking the DeFi ecosystem with flash loans for fun and profit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03810v2)


> Download PDF Abstract: Credit allows a lender to loan out surplus capital to a borrower. In the traditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its debt, the lender hence requires an upfront collateral from the borrower, plus interest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders can offer flash loans, i.e. loans that are only valid within one transaction and must be repaid by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a number of interesting attack possibilities, some of which have been exploited recently (February 2020).

But actually deploying it here is "very fragmented" given the maze of local regulations and agencies that telecom companies have to navigate across 50 states, said Jefferson Wang, head of 5G strategy at Accenture.

> Apple rolled out four separate smartphone models at its October 13 launch event. That's the largest range we've ever seen from the company. While the iPhone 12 itself is the expected mainstream front runner, the iPhone 12 mini provides something excitingly new. Not only is it a very small phone at a time when such things are as rare as hen's teeth, but it also manages to shrink things down without compromising on features or specifications. All of which begs the question: is the iPhone 12 really the best option for most people? Or is Apple's smaller, cheaper alternative a better buy? iPhone 12 vs iPhone 12 mini price and availability The iPhone 12 hit shops on October 23, while the iPhone 12 mini landed a little later on November 13.

> How many parents really know what their children are exposed to on the internet? We're familiar with the many dangers lurking there: exposure to harmful content, bullying, communication with strangers, sexual exploitation, pornography, identity theft and fraud. Most parents don't want to go snooping through their kids' phones and computers, but even if they did, they can't supervise their children all the time, and the dangers are too sophisticated for ordinary people to deal with. The usual solution for parents is to rely on parental control technologies – various kinds of software that filters and blocks content or follows kids' internet habits without their knowledge.

I have downloaded the iPhone_5.5_13.4_17E255_Restore.ipsw and tried to install it with reiboot and dr.phone. (Windows 10 machine) Both give errors and I am unable to upgrade.

Source code: https://github.com/chonyy/ML-auto-baseball-pitching-overlay I know some of you may have already seen it. However, I have made some improvements and I will want to share it. The model accuracy is hugely increased I implemented Polyfit to keep track of the ball just in case it lost the detection in some of the frames After all, I'm happy to say that it now is able to overlay as many clips as you want!

In an interview to air on Fox Broadcasting's 'Fox News Sunday' this Sunday (Jan. 17), Cook told anchor Chris Wallace that Apple 'looked at the incitement to violence that was on there and… we don't consider that free speech.' Asked by Wallace whether Apple's booting of Parler, which had become popular among Trump loyalists as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook, would only serve to drive the app's users 'underground,' Cook responded, 'Well, we've only suspended them, Chris.

Lebowitz's musings across seven episodes are organized by loose themes, such as 'Metropolitan Transit' and 'Library Services,' with the more recent footage interspersed with clips from older interviews. That's pretty much it as far as structure goes; while Lebowitz shares a number of amusing anecdotes, there's no attempt to explore the broader arc of her career or explain why we're watching a show about her.

> In order to consider an initiative around hyperautomation, firstly it is important to examine the current systems, reengineer the processes as required and eliminate unnecessary steps in tune with the business realities.Organisations that have embraced digital transformation have recognised the advantages that Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has to offer and many of them have implemented it in their key business areas. By enabling businesses to automate certain tasks, RPA has eliminated mundane manual tasks, enhanced cycle time thus ensuring predictability, accuracy, standardization, flexibility and better control.

In a world where information, data and words can be misconstrued, misunderstood and manipulated, we need to move away from the idea of free speech and instead to one of rights to speech. Rights confer a privilege to be understood and considered when communicating. This should bring to bear the implication of speech associated with context, audience, platform and interpretation.

> BL Research BureauThe rupee (INR) settled higher by 18 paise last week as it ended at 73.06 versus preceding week's close of 73.24 against the dollar (USD). However, the local currency seems to have opened with a considerable gap-down today, erasing last week's gain. That is, INR has opened at 73.23 and it is currently testing the key level of 73.25.A break below this level can drag the local currency towards the support band of 73.40 and 73.50. A breach of these levels can intensify the sell-off and take the exchange rate to 73.

Bird says that scooters can skid for various reasons, all of which point to serious problems with the rider of the vehicle: hazardous behavior, excessive breaking, and worn-out tires. The skid detection uses the scooter's existing vehicle diagnostics sensors, including an accelerometer that detects whether the scooter is upright or has been dumped on its side, and whether its components (including wheels and brakes) are all working as expected.

> That dismays Republicans who cheered Reagan's move — and say the current GOP proposals look a lot like a Fairness Doctrine for the internet. 'I am a big Trump supporter, but I totally disagree with the approach here,' said Mark Fowler, a Reagan appointee who led the charge for rolling back the doctrine as chair of the Federal Communications Commission. 'I think it's a blunderbuss, kind of a Panzer, heavy-handed approach to trying to control the press.' Then-FCC Republican Mike O'Rielly expressed similar misgivings last summer after the president proposed a wide-ranging regulatory and legislative crackdown against bias in social media.

Late last year, governments in the U.S., China and Europe separately began investigating whether Big Tech is too big. The scrutiny in Washington is expected to continue under a Biden administration, which also appears inclined to continue the Trump administration's export restrictions against Chinese companies that are reshuffling global supply chains.

If that sounds familiar, you're not alone. The pandemic has taken a toll on everyone's mental health, and there's data to prove it. While there's been ample discussion of the economic fallout from a global pandemic, the toll it takes on our collective mental health is harder to quantify. It's almost impossible to stay at home for months on end, cancel years worth of events, and disrupt even basic routines like how we shop for groceries without a significant impact on our mental health.

> Cloud hosting has changed the hosting industry for the better, allowing for increasing reliability and resilience for clients. Signing up for a simple web hosting package would usually buy you a defined block of resources on a single server: register your domain name, then choose this much web space, that much bandwidth, maybe a set amount of RAM or CPU cores.While this works well for many websites, having fixed resources can be a problem for larger projects.

[From 6s to 12 mini – reflections on how little has changed](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/from-6s-to-12-mini-reflections-on-how-little-has-changed.2280850/)


> My trusted iPhone 6S stopped working during the weekend and all of sudden I had no other option but to buy a new phone. I liked the old form factor, and settled on the 12 mini. I assume many people on this forum are updating the phones much more often, so I thought to write a few lines on what if feels like to fast-forward five years in the world of mobile phones. My gut feeling is that the development has been surprisingly incremental. Feels like much smaller change than my last switch from iPhone 5 to 6s.
