Of course, this time the Steelers won't be resting their first-string starters like QB Ben Roethlisberger and will be pushing themselves to the limit this time. Also coming off a restful weekend for the Steelers will be J.J. Watt and Cam Howard. Even without several impactful starters, Pittsburgh still nearly beat the Browns. It's optimistic to assume Cleveland will be moving on past week 18.

"Now, that means that if you have an underlying health condition that increases your risk of Covid and you're 25, it has to be approaching an increased risk of 100 fold to overcome the protective effects of age," said Mr Brown According to the scientist, people with rare illnesses who are particularly at risk can access an early vaccine under exceptional circumstances.

[Review: OnePlus Band is just not worth your time (or money)](https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-band-review)

OnePlus followed the Q1 with the U1 and budget-focused Y1 series, and it has carved out a niche for itself in India in this category.
