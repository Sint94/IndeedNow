Apple and Google said not anymore](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/parler-pitched-itself-as-twitter-without-rules-apple-and-google-said-not-anymore-7139226/): Written by Jack Nicas Parler is one of the hottest apps in the world, a social network that has attracted millions of conservatives over the past year with its hands-off approach to policing users' posts. And with the news that President Donald Trump had been kicked off Twitter and Facebook, Parler was the odds-on bet to be his next soapbox. But just as it was gaining new clout, Parler is now suddenly faced with an existential crisis.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png On Friday, Apple told the company that it had to step up its policing of the conversation on its app — undercutting its flagship feature — or lose its platform on iPhones.
- [Google suspends 'free speech' app Parler](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55598887): Google has suspended "free speech" social network Parler from its Play Store over its failure to remove "egregious content". Parler styles itself as "unbiased" social media and has proved popular with people banned from Twitter. But Google said the app had failed to remove posts inciting violence. Apple has also warned Parler it will remove the app from its App Store if it does not comply with its content-moderation requirements. On Parler, the app's chief executive John Matze said: "We won't cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!" Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among supporters of US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives.

>Google suspended the social media platform Parler on Friday from its Google Play app store until the 'Twitter for conservatives' adopts content moderation policies following the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump supporters. Parler, founded in 2018, has found traction among conservative users looking for alternatives to more mainstream apps like Facebook and Twitter, which moderate content more rigorously. Parler has banned users for trolling conservatives but doesn't have a formal set of moderation policies.

>A gamer knows that there's more to a gaming laptop than raw speed. You can pack a gaming laptop with the best graphics card, the fastest, most colorful display around, a gazillion-core processor, tons of fast solid-state drive storage to hold your games, and a rock-solid hard drive for secondary storage -- and it can still fall short. Those powerful components may overheat at the worst moments or you might experience some instability that impacts your gaming performance. Or maybe you don't want to always use an external mechanical keyboard , but the built-in backlit keyboard feels like mashed potatoes under your WASD keys .
