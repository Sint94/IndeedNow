It may not display this or other websites correctly.You should upgrade or use an alternative browser. Bought two LG UK670's and when I connect to the HDMI on one, it looks way sharper and colors are much better. On USB C, the monitor is too bright. Confirmed the settings are the same. And when flip the HDMIs, the pictures flip. Hoping to get them to match. Will I need something like a Caldigit to connect a display port - instead of using the USC C.
